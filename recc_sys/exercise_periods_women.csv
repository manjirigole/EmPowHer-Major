BACKGROUND: Menopause is a natural occurrence signifying the cessation of  menstrual bleeding in middle-aged women. Perimenopause refers to a period of 2-8  years leading up to menopause, characterized by irregular cycles or the absence  of menstruation for less than 12 months. The perimenopausal phase can be  challenging for women due to the negative impact of associated symptoms on their  quality of life. Recognizing the potential benefits of physical activity in  mitigating these symptoms, this study aimed to evaluate the impact of physical  activity education delivered via WhatsApp, using the Health Belief Model as a  foundation, on the quality of life in perimenopausal women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This quasi-experimental study involved 80 women aged  40-50 recruited from comprehensive health centers in Isfahan. Cluster sampling  was employed for participant selection. The study employed three questionnaires:  the ""International Physical Activity Questionnaire,"" ""Menopausal Women Quality  of Life,"" and the Health Belief Model Questionnaire. For the intervention group,  education based on the Health Belief Model was delivered via WhatsApp via  videos, posters, and podcasts every two weeks (a total of 5 packages).  Additionally, exercise training videos were sent to participants. Data was  collected two months after the intervention and analyzed using SPSS 26, with  independent and paired t-tests applied (significance level: 0.05). RESULTS: The results indicated a significant increase in knowledge scores,  Health Belief Model constructs, and physical activity levels within the  intervention group, whereas no significant changes were observed in the control  group. Notably, menopausal symptom scores decreased in the intervention group,  particularly in psychological symptoms, and there was a significant decrease in  the overall quality of life score (P = 0.018). CONCLUSION: Providing education via WhatsApp, grounded in the Health Belief  Model, enhanced physical activity levels and improved the quality of life among  perimenopausal women. This approach holds promise for promoting well-being in  perimenopause.  Copyright: © 2025 Journal of Education and Health Promotion.

INTRODUCTION: Aerobic exercise has been confirmed to alleviate primary  dysmenorrhea (PD) in adolescents and young women. However, the effect of the  aerobic exercise type and dosage on PD alleviation was unclear. This research  aims to assess the effect of aerobic exercise on PD and investigate the  dose-response relationships. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Systematic literature searches of Web of Science, Embass,  Cochrane Library, PubMed, PsycNET, CINAHL, CNKI, Baidu Scholar, Google Scholar,  and other Complimentary Medicine Database. PICOS standards were adopted in this  research: participants were nonathlete women with PD; intervention was aerobic  exercise of at least one menstruation cycle; comparator was any comparator;  outcomes were pain intensity or pain duration; and study type was randomized  controlled trials. The Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool was used to  assess the quality of the research. Random-effect meta-analysis was conducted  for pain intensity and pain duration, with prespecified subgroup analyses based  on aerobic exercise components. The strength of the evidence was assessed using  GRADE. This systematic review and meta-analysis was registered in PROSPERO  (CRD42024533544). RESULTS: The study identified 16 eligible studies, with 15 involving  adolescents, totaling 918 participants aged 15 to 43, with an average age of  21.26 ± 13.15. The results confirmed that aerobic exercise can alleviate PD's  pain intensity (standard mean difference (SMD) = -1.728 (p = 0.00), 95% CI  [-2.26 to -1.31]) and pain duration (weighted mean difference (WMD) = -12.53 h,  p = 0.01, 95% CI: -21.38 to -3.68). However, the heterogeneity of these two  results was high. Subgroup analysis showed that Pilates (SMD = -3.17, 95% CI  [-4.26 to -2.07]), low intensity (SMD = -1.64, 95% CI [-2.10 to -1.19]),  31-45 min duration (SMD = -3.05, 95% CI [-5.36 to -0.75]), ≤2 times per week  frequency (SMD = -2.24, 95% CI [-3.36 to -1.12]), and a period cycle of 2  menstrual cycles (SMD = -2.21, 95% CI [-3.13 to -1.28]) had the maximum effect  size. CONCLUSIONS: Aerobic exercise was able to alleviate pain intensity and pain  duration in adolescents and young women with PD. Moderate-quality evidence  indicates that Pilates, low intensity, 46-60 min, ≤two times per week, or two  menstrual cycles showed more efficiency in alleviating PD. Due to the limited  data, future research should prioritize conducting randomized controlled trials  of aerobic exercise interventions in younger age groups to develop personalized  treatment strategies for adolescents.  © 2025 The Author(s).

Alterations in inflammatory Th17 and  regulatory T cells (Treg) are associated with autoimmunity. In Hobart, Australia  (latitude 42.8° south), thirteen girls (aged 12-13) and sixteen women had blood  collected in the evening in daylight in February/March, (post 15 h daylight) and  at the same time in the dark in August/September (post 9 h daylight). Height and  weight were measured. Participants completed online surveys prior around  menstruation, sleep, exercise and time outside. Proportions of Th17 (CD4 + ,  CXCR3-, CCR4 + , CCR6 + , CD161 +), total Treg (CD4 + , CD25 + , CD127low),  naïve Treg (CD45RA + , CD4 + , CD25 + , CD127low) and memory Treg (CD45RA low,  CD4 + , CD25 + , CD127low) were enumerated by flow cytometry (Cytek Aurora).  Hours spent outside was greater in summer than winter (12.5 v 10.5, p = 0.0003).  The %Treg/CD4 + was higher in summer than winter (7.3% vs 7%, p = 0.004)  including memory Treg (3.1% vs 2.9%, p = 0.02) for all females (n = 29), and  naïve Treg were 13% higher in summer in women (3.2% vs 2.8%, p = 0.0009),  whereas %Th17 remained unchanged. In women, a negative correlation between the  number of hours spent outside in summer and %Th17 was observed (r = - 0.53,  p = 0.035). The %Th17 cells were higher in women than girls (4.9% vs 3.1%,  p = 0.001), whereas girls had a higher total %Treg (7.6% vs 6.7%, p = 0.005),  consisting of a higher naïve Treg (5.5% vs 3.7%, p = 0.0001) while the women had  a higher %memory Treg (3.4% vs 2.6%, p = 0.0001). These light-dependent seasonal  differences may influence immune development in adolescents.  © 2024. The Author(s).

The objective of this study was to investigate the barriers experienced by elite  women football players due to their menstrual cycle, and coping strategies  utilised against these barriers. Fifteen elite women footballers from two  English Women's Super League clubs (age: 25.2 years [18-33]) were interviewed  using semi-structured interviews, developed using piloting and peer review. Data  was audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically using NVivo.  Analysis of 27,438 words unveiled key themes: internal barriers, external  barriers, coping strategies, and player needs. Fear of leakage, associated with  kit colour (n = 15) and lack of effective sanitary products (n = 12), and injury  anxiety (n = 7), associated with ACL injury (n = 5), were the most common  barriers. To combat these issues, players use internal (feeling fortunate n = 9)  and external (support from teammates n = 6; support from club staff n = 4)  coping strategies. The findings indicated that menstruation presents significant  barriers to players. Increased awareness of menstruation-related barriers to  performance and targeted intervention are achievable through staff and player  involvement and by minimising concerns of visible leakage by kit interventions.

OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study was to describe the  self-reported reproductive health of retired elite women's footballers with  specific reference to menstrual function, pregnancy and motherhood,  contraceptive use and pelvic floor function. METHODS: An electronic survey was disseminated to women's footballers (18 years  or older) who had retired from elite football within 10 years of completing the  survey. RESULTS: 69 respondents completed the survey (mean age 35.8 years, mean age at  retirement 30.3 years). One-third of participants self-reported experiencing at  least one episode of amenorrhoea (>3 months without menstruation) for reasons  other than hormonal contraceptive use or pregnancy. Three participants (mean age  of 41 years, range 30-54) reported having reached menopause at the time of the  study. 54 (78.3%) participants were not using any form of contraception. 17  (24.6%) of the participants are mothers (range 1-3 children). 51 of the  participants (73.9%) had never been pregnant, and the majority of those who had  been pregnant (86.7%) became pregnant in less than 2 years following the onset  of desire for pregnancy. Four of the retired players gave birth during their  playing career, and the mean time to return to competitive matches following  delivery was 22 weeks. The mean Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory-20 score for  participants was 72. CONCLUSION: These insights can be used to inform future efforts to promote  positive reproductive health outcomes for current, former and future women's  footballers. Research efforts should focus on improving the understanding of how  to effectively support women's footballers in the perinatal period. Best  practice guidelines on the use of menstrual cycle monitoring and pelvic health  support would improve standards of care for women's footballers. Stakeholders  should consider gender-specific postretirement care for women's footballers.  Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024. Re-use permitted under CC  BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

The hormonal changes in women influence creatine dynamics, emphasizing its  potential importance during menstruation, pregnancy, postpartum, menopause, and  postmenopause. Yet, limited research explores creatine's impact on female  reproductive health at the population level. Our study investigated the  relationship between dietary creatine intake and reproductive health indices in  US women using data from the 2017-2020 National Health and Nutrition Examination  Survey (NHANES). We extracted a dataset containing females aged 12 years and  above who provided details about their reproductive health and dietary habits.  Daily creatine intake was quantified as a relative amount (mg per kg body mass)  and did not include creatine from dietary supplements and pharmacological  agents. A daily requirement for dietary creatine for healthy women was employed  to classify respondents into two separate subpopulations: (1) suboptimal intake  of creatine (<13 mg per kg body mass per day) or (2) recommended intake (dietary  creatine ≥ 13 mg per kg body mass per day). A total of 4522 female participants  from the NHANES study (age 44.5 ± 20.5 years) provided data on their  reproductive health and dietary intake. The average daily creatine intake for  the group was 10.5 ± 10.8 mg per kg body mass. The odds ratio for having  irregular periods in women consuming ≥13 mg of creatine per kg body mass daily  (recommended intake) compared to those with suboptimal intake was 0.75 (95% CI,  from 0.66 to 0.86), indicating a significant association between higher intake  of dietary creatine and lower risk of oligomenorrhea (p < .001). Moreover, women  consuming less than 13 mg of creatine per kg body mass faced an increased risk  of fetal macrosomia (OR 1.26; p = .04), pelvic infection (OR 1.68; p = .01),  hysterectomy (OR 1.42; p < .001), oophorectomy (OR 1.54; p < .001), and  receiving hormone replacement therapy (OR 1.26; p = .02). Consuming a  creatine-rich diet has been linked to lower risks of reproductive issues in US  women aged 12 and above. Those consuming ≥13 mg of creatine per kg body mass  daily showed notably lower risks of irregular menstrual periods, obstetric  conditions, and pelvic pathology. Further studies are needed to confirm these  potential benefits.  © 2024 The Authors. Food Science & Nutrition published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.

The impact of intensive sport on the  menstrual cycle varies according to the individual and the nutritional balance  in relation to energy expenditure; impaired reproductive function with menstrual  disturbances is an indicator of the syndrome of relative energy deficiency in  sport (REDs). Raising the awareness of the female elite athlete, her sport  environment, her family and the health professionals in charge of medical care  enables better prevention and avoids harmful consequences on bone metabolism,  reduced immunity and cardiovascular risk, among others, and the impact on  endurance and resistance performance. The absence of a menstrual cycle, apart  from hormonal contraception, is incompatible with the research of sport  performance. Similarly, moderate to severe dysmenorrhea, heavy menstrual periods  which are a source of iron-deficiency anemia, and premenstrual syndrome which  interferes with training, should not be treated as a fatality or taboo subject,  but should be managed by appropriate treatment and explained to the athlete to  ensure care compliance.  Publisher: JEUNES FEMMES ET SPORT DE HAUT NIVEAU. L’impact du sport intensif sur  le cycle menstruel varie en fonction de chacune, de l’équilibre nutritionnel par  rapport à la dépense énergétique ; les perturbations du cycle menstruel  constituent un indicateur du syndrome de déficit énergétique relatif dans le  sport (REDs). La sensibilisation de la sportive, de son environnement sportif,  familial et des professionnels de santé en charge du suivi médical permet une  meilleure prévention et évite notamment les conséquences néfastes sur le  métabolisme osseux, la diminution de l’immunité, le risque cardiovasculaire et  l’impact sur la performance en endurance et en résistance. L’absence de cycle  menstruel, hors contraception hormonale, est antinomique avec la recherche de la  performance. De la même façon, la dysménorrhée modérée à sévère, des règles  abondantes, sources d’anémie ferriprive ou un syndrome prémenstruel gênant  l’entraînement ne doivent pas être vécus comme une fatalité ou un sujet tabou,  mais être pris en charge par un traitement adapté et expliqué à la sportive pour  soutenir l’adhésion à la prise en charge.

This study investigated the impact of intensive endurance exercise on  circulating androgenic steroid hormones in women. Fifteen normally menstruating  athletic women participated. They completed intensive endurance exercise  (treadmill running) until volitional fatigue in their follicular phase, with  blood samples collected at pre-exercise, volitional fatigue, 90 min and 24 h  into recovery. The steroid hormones (total, free testosterone,  dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA], and DHEA-sulfate [DHEA-S], cortisol) were  analyzed in blood sera. Non-parametric statistics were used to assess changes  across exercise and recovery. At volitional fatigue, all hormones, except free  testosterone, were significantly (p < 0.05) increased compared to pre-exercise  levels. Most hormones remained elevated through 90 min of recovery, with DHEA,  DHEA-S, and total testosterone changes being significant (p < 0.05). At 24 h of  recovery, hormonal levels were reduced; specifically, DHEA, DHEA-S, and total  testosterone compared to baseline (p < 0.01 to 0.06). Increases in cortisol  levels at volitional fatigue and 90 min of recovery were correlated with  reductions in total testosterone, DHEA, and DHEA-S observed at 24 h of recovery  (rho > -0.62, p < 0.05). In conclusion, in menstruating women performing  intensive endurance exercise during their follicular phase, their androgenic  steroid hormones remain elevated during early recovery but are suppressed at 24  h of recovery. The latter finding indicates that establishing a resting  endocrine equilibrium requires a longer recovery period than 24 h.

Witkoś J(1), Luberda E(1), Błażejewski G(1), Strój E(1).  Author information: (1)Faculty of Medicine and Health Science, Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski Krakow  University, Kraków, Poland.  Physique competitions are weight-sensitive sports in which stage presentation,  aesthetic appearance and posing ability of the athletes are judged rather than  physical performance. The aim of this study was to assess low energy  availability among female physique athletes by using the LEAF-Q. The study  involved 104 females who were physique athletes. Monthly cycle disorders were  reported in 58.65% of the women, that is periods stopped for three consecutive  months or longer (amenorrhea). This situation occurred before the research was  conducted in 43.27% of athletes and during the research in 15.38%. The physique  athletes claimed that menstruation changes occurred when there was an increased  exercise intensity, frequency or duration. Absence from training due to injury  was reported by 27.88% of the women. The LEAF-Q identified 46.15% of the  physique athletes as at risk (score ≥ 8) of low energy availability and the  physiological consequences related to RED-S. Women who had menstrual cycle  disorders were younger and did more training per week. Among women with  menstrual disorders, cramps or stomach ache which cannot be related to  menstruation occurred more frequently (p = 0.004). Absence from training or lack  of participation in competition due to injuries occurred more frequently in the  score ≥ 8 group (p = 0.024) thank the ≤ score 8 group. In the score ≥ 8 group  menstruation changes, that is less bleeding or cessation of menstruation (p =  0.035), occurred more frequently when there was an increase in exercise  intensity, frequency or duration (p = 0.002).

BACKGROUND: Primary dysmenorrhea, commonly known as menstrual cramps, is a  prevalent gynecological issue that impacts many women in their childbearing age.  It manifests as reoccurring, cramp-like lower abdominal pain, usually commencing  right prior to or during the menstrual period. These painful sensations can be  severe, extending to the lower back and upper thighs can greatly disrupt a  woman's daily life and overall well-being. The optimal exercise approach is  needed for individuals seeking relief from primary dysmenorrhea, allowing  healthcare providers and women themselves to make informed decisions regarding  their treatment options. Though many forms of exercise interventions exist in  the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea, this study aims to compare two forms of  intervention namely pilates and gym ball exercises on pain and menstrual  distress among women with Primary Dysmenorrhea. METHODS: This experimental comparative study was carried out with 30 young  female participants over a 12-week period. Participant recruitment was done  through a simple random sampling method. The criteria of inclusion encompassed  young females aged 17-25 years, those in good health, and those experiencing  primary dysmenorrhea. Exclusion criteria included secondary dysmenorrhea,  medication use, polycystic ovarian syndrome, bleeding disorders, positive  pregnancy tests, breastfeeding, and other medical conditions. Group A received  Pilates exercises, while Group B underwent Gym ball exercises. The assessment of  both groups' menstrual distress levels was conducted using the Moos Menstrual  Distress Questionnaire (MDQ) and pain scores using the Visual Analog Scale  (VAS). RESULT: In the statistical analysis, Group A (Pilates Exercises) showed a  significantly lower mean value (2.60) on the VAS compared to Group B (Swiss Ball  Exercises) (5.46), with both groups experiencing a notable reduction in  post-test scores (p ≤ 0.001). Additionally, on the MOOS MDQ score, Group A  (Pilates Exercises) achieved a lower mean value (79.33) compared to Group B  (Swiss Ball Exercises) (103.26), with both groups demonstrating a significant  decrease in post-test scores (p ≤ 0.001). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this study underscores the significance of exercise  therapy, particularly Pilates exercises, as a holistic approach to addressing  primary dysmenorrhea, improving physical well-being, and enhancing the overall  quality of life.

This study explored the extent of menstrual manipulation and its associated  impact on period-related symptoms and training disruptions in Australian Female  Cyclists. 205 female cyclists, from recreational to elite level, participated in  an online ""Female Cyclist Questionnaire (FCQ)"". The FCQ utilised a series of  validated questionnaires to obtain demographic information and menstrual  function of the respondents, and to investigate their menstrual manipulation  habits and perceptions on how their period-related symptoms affected their  well-being, mood, energy and training tolerance. More than 80% of the cyclists  reported that their period-related symptoms impacted upon training and 41% made  training adjustments based on these symptoms. Two-thirds of respondents thought  their training should be phase-controlled yet only half discussed their hormonal  cycles with their coaches. Menstrual manipulation was predicted by reduced  ""workout tolerance"" in these cyclists (odds ratio = 0.632). Half of the  respondents reported compromised ability to tolerate high-intensity interval  training with period-related symptoms. Period pain, increased irritability,  lower energy levels and more sugar cravings were commonly reported but did not  predict menstrual manipulation. The data indicated that period-related symptoms  are present in Australian female cyclists across all levels of participation.  However, the perceived impact to training and subsequent behavioural changes  varied among individuals.  DOI: 10.1080/02640414.2024.2334485 PMID: 38590213 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Electronic address: Joanna.blodgett@ucl.ac.uk.  PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the association between psychological  distress (PD) at age 16 and menstrual symptoms experienced across women's life. METHODS: Up to 2584 females from the 1970 British Cohort Study, a study of  individuals born within one week in 1970, were included. PD at age 16 was  measured with the 12-item General Health Questionnaire. Three categories were  derived: low PD (<11), moderate PD (11-15), and severe PD (>15). Five menstrual  health symptoms were self-reported at each age (16, 30 and 42 years). Binomial  logistic regressions examined associations between PD at age 16 and each  individual symptom, adjusted for age of menarche, sleep and appetite problems,  physical activity levels and socioeconomic position. RESULTS: The most prevalent symptoms were ""pain"" (61 %), ""painful period"" (10 %)  and ""heavy period"" (33 %) at ages 16, 30 and 42, respectively. At age 16, those  with severe PD were more likely to experience depression (OR: 2.92; 95% CI:  2.31, 3.70)), irritability (1.67; 1.33, 2.11), menstrual pain (1.34; 1.01,  1.80), and headaches (1.29; 1.02, 1.63). A weak association was found between  severe PD at age 16 and pre-menstrual tension at age 30 (1.72; 1.01, 2.83). At  age 42, those with severe PD at age 16 were more likely to experience  pre-menstrual tension (1.89; 1.46, 2.44), painful periods (1.64; 1.27, 2.11),  and heavy periods (1.28; 1.00, 1.62). DISCUSSION: Menstruating females with higher levels of PD in adolescence have an  increased risk of menstrual symptoms across adolescence, early and  mid-adulthood. Our findings suggest the need to consider early-life  psychological interventions to improve women's menstrual experiences across  their reproductive years.  Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

(3)Department of Integrative Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of  Pécs, 7621 Pécs, Hungary.  Background and Objective: Primary dysmenorrhea (PD) is one of the most common  clinical disorders in women of reproductive age. Our aim was to examine whether  a twice-weekly thirty-minute Aviva exercise intervention could result in  improvements in pain level and body awareness in patients with PD. Materials and  Methods: In our prospective observational trial, the observation period included  two consecutive menstrual cycles and the period of the next menstrual bleeding.  The first menstrual bleeding period was the first measurement time (T1), the  second was the second measurement time (T2), and the third was the third  measurement time (T3) in a total of 78 volunteers. The primary endpoint was the  change in the level of menstrual pain according to the Numeric Rating Scale  (NRS) questionnaire between the intervention group (IG) and the control group  (CG) at T1, T2, and T3. In this study, the secondary outcomes were the  differences between the IG and CG regarding the different subscales of the  Hungarian version of the Body Awareness Questionnaire (BAQ-H) at T1, T2, and T3;  the Borg scale results of the IG; and adherence to the intervention. Statistical  tests such as independent-sample t-tests, chi-square tests, Pearson's linear  correlation coefficient, and repeated-measure ANCOVA were used for the analyses.  Results: In total, 78 volunteers were enrolled: 40 persons in the IG and 38 in  the CG. There was a significant change in the level of menstruation pain  according to the NRS questionnaire between the IG and CG (p < 0.001). There was  no significant difference between the IG and CG regarding the different  subscales of the BAQ-H. Only in the case of the ""Note responses or changes in  body process"" subscale of the BAQ-H was there a trend-like effect from the Aviva  exercises (p = 0.086). Conclusions: The Aviva exercise could contribute to pain  relief from PD. Regarding body awareness, no significant difference was found  between the two groups. Due to the short detection period and prospective  observational design, our results are preliminary and need to be confirmed in  larger clinical trials.

BACKGROUND: Muscle strength is affected by different stages of the menstrual  cycle in women. Since the strength of the lower limb muscles plays a significant  role in the occurrence of anterior cruciate ligament injury, it seems necessary  to study the strength of the lower limb muscles at different stages of this  cycle to take preventive measures. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the  isometric and isokinetic strength of lower limb muscles in female athletes at  different menstrual cycle stages. METHODS: The present study is of a causal-comparative type. Thirty-seven female  athletes in anterior cruciate ligament injury high-risk disciplines participated  in this study. Isometric and isokinetic knee extensors and flexors muscle  strength status, including the traditional hamstrings/quadriceps (H/Q) ratios,  were recorded at different stages of the menstrual cycle (follicular, ovulatory,  luteal) by Biodex isokinetic dynamometry system 4. Then, the obtained results  were analyzed by repeated measure analysis of variance. RESULTS: Analysis of variance with repeated measures showed isokinetic and  isometric strength in the knee flexor and extensor muscles at an angular  velocity of 60˚/s in the ovulatory phase are higher than the follicular and  luteal ones. The strength of the muscles declined during the follicular and  luteal phases (p ≤ 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Due to the negative effect of the follicular and luteal stages of  the menstrual cycle on the strength of the flexor and extensor muscles of the  knee, the risk of anterior cruciate ligament injury may increase during this  period. Therefore, it is recommended that all female coaches and athletes take  preventive measures during this period.  © 2023. The Author(s).

Medicina (Kaunas). 2023 Nov 20;59(11):2044. doi: 10.3390/medicina59112044.  Premenstrual Syndrome and Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder's Impact on Quality of  Life, and the Role of Physical Activity.  Liguori F(1), Saraiello E(1), Calella P(1).  Author information: (1)Department of Medical, Movement Sciences and Wellbeing, University of Naples  ""Parthenope"", 80133 Naples, Italy.  Most women who menstruate experience various physical, psychological, and  behavioral changes during the period between ovulation and menstruation. This  study focuses on defining and diagnosing premenstrual disorders, distinguishing  between premenstrual symptoms (PS), PMS, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder  (PMDD). It highlights the prevalence of these conditions and their impact on  women's quality of life, including social, occupational, and psychological  aspects. Furthermore, the study examines the role of physical activity,  particularly aerobic exercise, in managing premenstrual symptoms. Several  systematic reviews are cited, suggesting that regular physical activity can  effectively reduce both physical and psychological symptoms associated with PMS.  In conclusion, the management of PMS involves a multifaceted approach, with  exercises, dietary modifications, stress management, cognitive-behavioral  therapy, and medications all playing roles. Physical activity, especially  aerobic exercise, has been found to be an effective non-pharmacological therapy  for alleviating PMS symptoms and improving overall well-being. However, more  research is needed to determine the optimal type and dosage of exercise for  individual women with PMS.

(3)Department of Integrative Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of  Pécs, 7621 Pécs, Hungary.  BACKGROUND: Primary dysmenorrhea (PD) is one of the most common diseases in  women of reproductive age. Our aim was to examine whether a twice-weekly  thirty-minute exercise intervention could result in a difference in the  pulsatility index (PI) of the uterine arteries (UAs) and level of menstrual pain  in patients with PD. METHODS: In our prospective observational trial, the observation period included  one spontaneous menstrual cycle and the consecutive time of the next  menstruation of all participants, aged 18-44, with no extensive sports  experience. In total, 73 volunteers were enrolled: 38 persons in the  intervention group (IG) and 35 in the control group (CG). The intervention  program was accompanied by music, performed in groups under the supervision of a  qualified instructor in Hungary. The primary outcome was the difference between  the IG and CG regarding the PI values of UAs at the 1st and the 2nd ultrasound  (US) Doppler flowmetry. The secondary outcome was the difference between the IG  and CG regarding the PI of UAs and menstrual pain measured by using the Numeric  Rating Scale and adherence to the intervention. Statistical tests such as an  independent-samples t-test, chi-square test, Mann-Whitney test and analysis of  covariance (ANCOVA) were used during the analyses. RESULTS: Examining the mean of the PI of UAs in the IG and the CG at the 1st and  the 2nd US measurement, a significant difference was found in the change in the  measured value (Z = -2.545; p = 0.011). The IG showed a significantly higher  increase in the mean of the PI of UAs (Median = 0.825) than the CG (Median =  0.130). The difference in the PI of the UAs of the IG and the CG is not related  to the level of pain in any group (p = 0.336) and not related to the whole  sample (p = 0.354); furthermore, the level of pain did not significantly differ  between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to document the significant effects of  mild-to-moderate exercise training on the change in the PI of the UAs in  individuals with PD. The IG had a reduced blood flow due to circulatory  redistribution after exercise. The level of menstrual pain of primary  dysmenorrhea patients is independent of the level of blood circulation regarding  the PI of the UAs. Randomized controlled studies with more participants and a  longer research period are needed to confirm our findings regarding the  association between regular exercise and the PI of UAs. The study was registered  at clinicaltrials.gov: NCT04618172.

PURPOSE: The potential impact of hormonal contraceptives (HCs) on player health  and performance in women's rugby union (rugby) is not well understood, despite  rugby's growing popularity worldwide. This study investigated the prevalence of  HC use and reported associations with training and performance in a global  sample of women rugby players. METHOD: A globally distributed online survey, seeking to explore experiences in  women's rugby, was completed by 1596 current or former adult women 7s or 15s  rugby players (mean age 27 [6] y; 7 [5] y playing experience) from 62 countries.  The survey included a section of questions about reported HC use, including the  type, reason for use, symptoms, and experiences relating to rugby training and  performance. RESULTS: A total of 606 (38%) participants from 33 of the 62 (53%) countries  reported using HCs, with the combined oral contraceptive pill reported as the  most frequently used (44%). Almost half of participants using HCs (43%) tracked  HC-related symptoms. Over 10% reported altered rugby performance due to  HC-related symptoms, 22% required medication to manage symptoms, and 11% used  HCs to control or stop their menstrual periods for rugby training and  performance. CONCLUSIONS: The current study highlights the prevalence of HC use in women's  rugby, identifying practices that may negatively affect performance, health, and  well-being. Thus, there is an urgent need to better understand the motivations  for such practices and knowledge of potential side effects among women rugby  players across all levels and countries.

Author information: (1)Military Performance Division, United States Army Research Institute of  Environmental Medicine, Natick, MA.  PURPOSE: To determine whether changes in menstruation develop in female trainees  during BCT and whether changes in body mass, body composition and/or physical  activity are associated with menstrual interruption during BCT. METHODS: Female trainees grouped according to self-reported menstrual status in  the 12 months before BCT as having regular cycles (RC; n = 352) or MD ( n = 97)  completed height, body mass, and body composition assessments and questionnaires  before and after BCT. Fisher's exact test and Mann-Whitney U test were used to  compare between-group differences in categorical and continuous variables,  respectively. Among RC trainees, odds ratios were calculated to examine the  influence of changes in body mass, lean mass, and fat mass on a trainee's  likelihood to miss a period during BCT. RESULTS: There were no differences in race, height, body mass, body mass index,  or physical activity history at pre-BCT between RC and MD ( P > 0.05). Overall,  86% of trainees experienced changes to menstruation during BCT. RC were more  likely than MD to have at least one period during BCT (81% vs 69%, respectively,  P = 0.01). Among RC, gaining more body mass and lean mass and losing less fat  mass were associated with increased odds of missing a period during BCT. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that most female trainees experience  menstrual changes during BCT. Menstrual cycle interruptions do not appear to  align with loss of body or fat mass.

Professional athletes are often exposed to high training loads that may lead to  overfatigue, overreaching and overtraining that might have a detrimental effects  on vascular health. We determined the effects of high training stress on  endothelial function assessed by the flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and markers of  glycocalyx shedding. Vascular examination as well as broad biochemical, hormonal  and cardiometabolic evaluation of sprint and middle-distance female runners were  performed after 2 months of preparatory training period and compared to  age-matched control group of women. Female athletes presented with significantly  reduced FMD (p < 0.01) and higher basal serum concentrations of hyaluronan (HA)  and syndecan-1 (SDC-1) (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively), that was  accompanied by significantly lower basal serum testosterone (T) and free  testosterone (fT) concentrations (p < 0.05) and higher cortisol (C)  concentration (p < 0.05). It resulted in significantly lower T/C and fT/C ratios  in athletes when compared to controls (p < 0.01). Moreover, fT/C ratio were  significantly positively correlated to FMD and negatively to HA concentrations  in all studied women. Accordingly, the training load was significantly  negatively correlated with T/C, fT/C and FMD and positively with the  concentrations of HA and SDC-1. We concluded that young female track and field  athletes subjected to physical training developed impairment of endothelial  function that was associated with anabolic-catabolic hormone balance  disturbances. Given that training-induced impairment of endothelial function may  have a detrimental effects on vascular health, endothelial status should be  regularly monitored in the time-course of training process to minimalize  vascular health-risk in athletes.  © 2023.

Data was audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed  thematically using NVivo. RESULTS: All players (100%) perceive their menstrual cycle to negatively impact  performance. Analysing 27,438 words of data revealed five themes: A) symptoms,  B) preparation, C) performance, D) recovery, and E) management. Over half (53%)  of players experienced decreased appetite and sleep quality prior to performance  during menstruation. Competitive performance was perceived to be most negatively  impacted during menses (54 references) following by the pre-menstrual stage (23  references). During menstruation, the most impacted physical performance  indicators were power (93%) and fatigue (87%). Psychologically, confidence,  focus, and reaction to criticism were commonly affected (66.7%). Players  reported missing training (13.3%) and matches (13.3%) due to severity of impact.  Recovery was affected during the pre-menstrual (26.7%) and menstrual (66.7)  stages. Players self-manage symptoms using over the counter (66.7%) and  prescription (26.7%) medication, some prophylactically prior to competition  (46.7%). CONCLUSIONS: This first attempt to ascertain player perception in football  exposes a clear negative impact on performance. The complex interplay of  biopsychosocial and logistical factors, lack of awareness and education  highlight the need for further research. Intervention is necessary and immediate  initiation would be prudent, starting with simple measures such as basic  self-management advice, education, and provision of sanitary products.

Beyaz Ş(1), Gelincik A(2).  Author information: (1)Department of Immunology and Allergic Diseases, Ankara City Hospital, Ankara,  Turkey. (2)Division of Immunology and Allergic Diseases, Department of Internal  Medicine, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.  Anaphylaxis should be clinically diagnosed with immediate recognition, whereas,  despite advances in the field of allergy, the symptoms of anaphylaxis remain to  be under-recognized, diagnosis is often missed, and treatment is often delayed.  Anaphylaxis presents with symptoms in a spectrum of severity, ranging from mild  objective breathing problems to circulatory shock and/or collapse. Indeed,  anaphylaxis management frequently relies on a 'one-size-fits-all approach'  rather than a precision medicine care model, despite the evidence that  anaphylaxis is a heterogeneous condition with differences in causative agents,  clinical presentation, and host susceptibility. The key important risk factors  for severe anaphylaxis and mortality are certain age groups or certain stages of  life (infants, elderly and pregnant women), augmenting factors (physical  exercise, alcohol consumption, menstruation, acute infections), concurrent use  of some medications (beta-adrenergic blockers (β-blockers) and  angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory  drugs (NSAIDs), and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), and concomitant diseases  (i.e. asthma, cardiovascular disease, mastocytosis). The present review aims to  collectively address the patient groups who are at high risk of having  anaphylaxis, those who have a more severe course, those that are difficult to  diagnose, and require a special approach in treatment. Therefore, the risky  populations like the elderly, pregnant women, patients receiving β- blockers or  ACE inhibitors, those with concomitant cardiovascular diseases, asthma, and  mastocytosis, or those having higher baseline serum tryptase levels are  discussed, including their clinical presentations and treatment strategies.  Additionally, anaphylaxis during the perioperative period is addressed.  Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at  epub@benthamscience.net.

BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrinopathy that is  highly prevalent in women of Indian ethnicity. Clinical practice guidelines do  not adequately consider ethnic-cultural differences in the diagnosing and care  of women with PCOS. This study aimed to understand co-morbidities, key concerns,  quality of life (QoL), and diagnosis experiences of ethnic Indian women living  with PCOS. METHODS: Global online survey of ethnic Indian women of reproductive age living  with PCOS. RESULTS: Respondents (n = 4409) had a mean age of 26.8 (SD 5.5) years and  reported having a family history of type 2 diabetes (43%) and PCOS (18%). Most  of them (64%) were diagnosed with one or more co-morbidities (anxiety/depression  being the most common). Irregular periods, cysts on the ovaries, and excess  unwanted facial hair growth were their three top concerns. On average, women  experienced symptoms of PCOS at the age of 19.0 (SD 5.0) and were diagnosed at  the age of 20.8 years (SD 4.8). We report a one-year delay in seeking medical  help and a seven-month diagnostic delay, which were associated with poor  satisfaction with the information provided related to PCOS and its treatment  options (p < 0.01). Women living outside India reported difficulty losing weight  as their most key concern; however, they had higher dissatisfaction with the  information provided on diet (OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.6 to 0.8; p = 0.002), exercise  (OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.6 to 0.9; p = 0.002) and behavioural advice (OR, 0.74; 95%  CI, 0.6 to 0.9; p = 0.004) than women living in India. Most women reported poor  QoL in weight and emotion domains. CONCLUSIONS: Ethnic Indian women experience early onset of PCOS symptoms and  delay in seeking professional help. Timely diagnosis, providing  cultural-specific education related to lifestyle and weight management, and  improving psycho-emotional support are key areas that should be addressed in  clinical practice and future research.

In India, females who are menstruating are considered impure and teenage  girls are not allowed to undertake home chores or engage in religious or  cultural events during their period. Up-to-date knowledge about menstruation,  beginning in early adolescence, would improve safe practices and relieve the  distress of millions of women. Material and methods A cross-sectional study was  conducted among adolescent girls (10-19 years) residing in a tribal area of  Nagpur District from January to March 2022. Three tribal residential schools  (Ashram Shala) were selected from a total of six in Hingana Taluka of Nagpur  District, using simple random sampling to fulfill the required sample size of  272. Demographic details, age at menarche, awareness of menstruation, sources of  information about menstruation, menstrual hygiene practices, and restrictions  observed during menstruation were assessed. Results The average age at menarche  was 13.04+0.96 years (range 11-16 years). Only 45.17% of girls were aware of the  menarche and menstrual cycle before its onset. The duration of the menstrual  cycle ranged from 21-35 days in most of the girls (90.69%), and it was regular  in 85.86% of girls. Duration of bleeding was two to six days for the majority of  the girls (87.93%). Around 73.79% of girls were using sanitary pads, while  26.21% of girls were using clothes. The most important restrictions imposed on  the girls during menstruation were not being allowed to attend religious  functions (97.93%), followed by not being allowed to attend classes (65.86%).  The use of sanitary pads was significantly more in late adolescent girls than in  early adolescent girls (ꭓ2=14.97, p=0.0001), girls who have literate mothers  than girls with illiterate mothers (ꭓ2=5.17, p=0.02), and girls belonging to  higher socioeconomic classes (class I, II, III) than lower ones (class IV, V)  (ꭓ2=44.23, p<0.0001). Conclusion The tribal adolescent girls still don't  exercise proper hygiene throughout their periods. During menstruation, the  majority of girls are still subjected to various restrictions.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to aggregate different effects between  variable resistance training and traditional resistance training on maximal  muscle strength and muscle power and identify potential sex- and training  program-related moderator variables. DESIGN: Meta-analysis. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in SPORTDiscus, PubMed,  and Web of Science. Interventions were included if they compared variable  resistance training and traditional resistance training in healthy adults and  examined the effects on measures of maximal muscle strength and/or muscle power  of the lower and/or upper body. A random-effects model was used to calculate  weighted and averaged standardized mean differences. Additionally, univariate  sub-group analyses were independently computed for sex and training-related  moderator variables. RESULTS: Seventeen studies comprising a total of 491 participants (341 men and  150 women, age 18-37 years) were included in the analyses. In terms of maximal  muscle strength, there were no statistically significant differences between  variable resistance training and traditional resistance training for the lower  (p = 0.46, standardized mean difference = -0.10) or the upper body (p = 0.14,  standardized mean difference = -0.17). Additionally, there were no significant  training-related differences in muscle power for the lower (p = 0.16,  standardized mean difference = 0.21) or upper body (p = 0.81, standardized mean  difference = 0.05). Sub-group analyses showed a significant moderator effect for  training period and repetitions per set for maximal muscle strength in the lower  body (p = 0.03-0.04) with larger strength gains following traditional resistance  training when performing more repetitions per set (p = 0.02, standardized mean  difference = 0.43). No other significant sub-group effects were found  (p = 0.18-0.82). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that variable resistance training and  traditional resistance training are equally effective in improving maximal  muscle strength and muscle power in healthy adults.

(3)Musculoskeletal Physiology Research Group, Sport Health and Performance  Enhancement Research Centre, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, UK.  This case study follows a professional internationally capped female soccer  player's two-year journey from eumenorrhea, through injury, to amenorrhea, and  the challenges faced by the player and nutritionist. The two years are split  into three sections: (Areta et al. 2013) longitudinal profiling of the player,  (Baker et al. 2020) nutrition to support her return from injury, and (Beato et  al. 2018) investigation into the observed secondary amenorrhea. The cause of  amenorrhea was investigated through the assessment of energy availability via  doubly labelled water, remote food photography, blood biomarkers and resting  metabolic rate. Despite having secondary amenorrhea and anovulatory cycles, the  player did not have low energy availability. This study shows the importance for  practitioner's, particularly nutritionists, to not assume that all menstrual  irregularities are caused by low energy availability and could be caused by a  combination of factors (e.g., clinical, physiological, and psychological), which  requires a multi-disciplinary investigation and intervention team. This study  also showed that education needs to be provided about menstrual health to elite  female soccer players as the player (i) believed that not having a period was  beneficial for performance and unsure of possible health implications; (ii) was  convinced that a one-day bleed indicated a regular menstrual cycle; and (iii)  was reluctant to waste the practitioners time discussing menstrual issues and  was nervous of finding out if she had an actual health issue. It is therefore  crucial that players feel comfortable in discussing their menstrual status with  practitioners to support their performance and long-term health.

This study (1) assessed the impact different stages of the menstrual cycle has  on experienced football performance and exercise ability (2) identified the  experienced barriers to football participation menstruation presents in amateur  women footballers. An online survey was used. The inclusion criteria were  non-professional, women currently experiencing regular menstrual cycles, ≥18  years, ≥60 min football/week in the UK. Descriptive statistics were performed on  quantitative data and thematic analysis of the open-ended questions. 127  responses were included. Most of the respondents were aged between 18-25 (89%),  Caucasian (83%) and competing in Universities Leagues (69%). Menstruation was  reported to ""never"" limit football playing in 17%, ""sometimes"" in 47%, ""rarely""  in 25% and ""always"" in 10% of respondents. The majority (73%) reported one or  more barriers menstruation present to football participation. Following thematic  analysis, 165 meaning units, 23 themes and seven categories were identified.  Confidence and aerobic capacity/endurance were identified to be the aspects most  negatively impacted during the pre-menstrual and menstrual stages. Confidence is  likely to be negatively impacted due to the barriers identified. Thus,  recommendations on how to reduce these through education of players and involved  staff, at the club and the FA level have been made.

To evaluate if experiencing a short-term exposure (18-months) to factors such as  menstrual irregularities, dieting, changes in exercise or body weight, and  medication usage is associated with bone mineral density (BMD) in college-aged  females. A retrospective survey assessing health behaviors during a recent  18-month time period and a DXA scan were completed in 641 females. A total of  45.5% of participants reported amenorrhea during the 18-month time period. Those  who experienced amenorrhea had lower femoral neck BMD (p = 0.018), trochanter (p  = 0.018) and spine BMD (p = 0.022) compared to eumenorrheic women. Lifetime oral  contraceptive usage longer than six months was negatively associated with BMD at  femoral neck (p = 0.018) and total hip (p = 0.021). Women who lost weight  trended towards having the lowest BMD at all sites compared to women who gained  weight. Following a very-low calorie diet during the time period was negatively  correlated with spine BMD (p = 0.001). Time spent in vigorous and very vigorous  activity was weakly correlated with some hip BMD sites but time spent in  extremely vigorous activity was not. In conclusion, females who experienced  weight loss, amenorrhea, or a very low-calorie diet within an 18-month period of  time in young adulthood had lower BMD. Additionally, oral contraceptive usage  for longer than six months during their lifetime was associated with lower BMD.

35839365,Care of the Active Female.,"Wojnowich K, Dhani R","1. Am Fam Physician. 2022 Jul;106(1):52-60.  Care of the Active Female.  Wojnowich K, Dhani R.  Physical activity has many health-related benefits, including prevention and  management of chronic disease, weight management, and improved mental health.  Active girls and women of all ages and abilities are at risk of relative energy  deficiency in sport, a syndrome encompassing low energy availability, menstrual  irregularities, and disordered bone metabolism. Presence of amenorrhea or  oligomenorrhea may suggest reduced energy availability. Active females are at  risk of overuse injuries, including patellofemoral pain syndrome, iliotibial  band syndrome, and stress fractures; treatment usually includes activity  modification, a period of rest, and physical therapy. Active females are also at  risk of acute injuries, including concussion and anterior cruciate ligament  injuries. Pregnant patients without contraindications who were physically active  before pregnancy can continue these activities, and those who were not  previously active may gradually increase their activity level to a goal of 150  minutes per week. Moderate exercise during pregnancy reduces the risk of  gestational diabetes mellitus, preeclampsia, and cesarean delivery. Postpartum  exercise focused on core and pelvic floor strengthening can improve pelvic floor  dysfunction. Supervised exercise programs focused on strength and balance have  been consistently shown to reduce the risk of falls and injurious falls in older  women.  PMID: 35839365 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of the menstrual cycle  phases on the movement patterns of sub-elite women soccer players during  competitive matches over three consecutive seasons. Individual movement data  were analyzed and compared in eight players from the second French League at the  early follicular (EF), late follicular (LF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases of their  menstrual cycle, determined by the calendar method. The movement patterns,  expressed as meters per minute, were recorded during competitive matches using  devices placed on the player's ankle. Our results showed significantly lower  distances covered at moderate and high velocity in the EF phase than in the LF  and ML phases (Cohen's d effect size = 1.03 and 0.79, respectively). The total  distance covered during matches and the number of sprints also were reduced  during EF compared with LF (d = 0.78 and 0.7, respectively). Overall, the total  distance and distance covered at low velocity were significantly lower during  the second half-time of the matches (d = 1.51), but no menstrual cycle phase ×  game period interaction was noted. In conclusion, our study suggests that EF may  impact the movement pattern of sub-elite women soccer players during competitive  matches, without any modulation of this effect by the playing time. Despite the  low sample size, these results can be useful for coaches and support staff to  modulate training loads and player rotation during soccer games.

This study aimed to investigate the difference in the prevalence, severity, and  risk factors of dysmenorrhea between Japanese female athletes and non-athletes  in universities. The participants were 18 to 30 years old with no history of a  previous pregnancy and/or childbirth. After application of the exclusion  criteria, the cohort comprised 605 athletes and 295 non-athletes. An anonymous  questionnaire, which included self-reported information on age, height, weight,  age at menarche, menstrual cycle days, menstrual duration, dysmenorrhea  severity, sleeping hours, dietary habits, exercise habits, training hours, and  competition level was administered. Compared with athletes, non-athletes had a  higher prevalence of dysmenorrhea (85.6% in athletes, 90.5% in non-athletes, p <  0.05); non-athletes also demonstrated increased severity (none/mild 27.8%,  moderate 19.3%, and severe 52.9% in athletes; none/mild 21.2%, moderate 17.2%,  and severe 61.6% in non-athletes; p < 0.05). Factors related to severe  dysmenorrhea in athletes included long training hours, early menarche, and  prolonged menstrual periods. In non-athletes, short menstrual cycle days and  extended menstrual periods were related to severe dysmenorrhea. The prevalence  and severity of dysmenorrhea were higher among non-athletes than among athletes;  different factors were related to severe dysmenorrhea in these two groups.

During their lifespan, many women are exposed to pain in the pelvis in relation  to menstruation and pregnancy. Such pelvic pain is often considered normal and  inherently linked to being a woman, which in turn leads to insufficiently  offered treatment for treatable aspects related to their pain experience.  Nonetheless, severe dysmenorrhea (pain during menstruation) as seen in  endometriosis and pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain, have a high impact on  daily activities, school attendance and work ability. In the context of any type  of chronic pain, accumulating evidence shows that an unhealthy lifestyle is  associated with pain development and pain severity. Furthermore, unhealthy  lifestyle habits are a suggested perpetuating factor of chronic pain. This is of  specific relevance during lifespan, since a low physical activity level, poor  sleep, or periods of (di)stress are all common in challenging periods of women's  lives (e.g., during menstruation, during pregnancy, in the postpartum period).  This state-of-the-art paper aims to review the role of lifestyle factors on pain  in the pelvis, and the added value of a lifestyle intervention on pain in women  with pelvic pain. Based on the current evidence, the benefits of physical  activity and exercise for women with pain in the pelvis are supported to some  extent. The available evidence on lifestyle factors such as sleep, (di)stress,  diet, and tobacco/alcohol use is, however, inconclusive. Very few studies are  available, and the studies which are available are of general low quality. Since  the role of lifestyle on the development and maintenance of pain in the pelvis,  and the value of lifestyle interventions for women with pain in the pelvis are  currently poorly studied, a research agenda is presented. There are a number of  rationales to study the effect of promoting a healthy lifestyle (early) in a  woman's life with regard to the prevention and management of pain in the pelvis.  Indeed, lifestyle interventions might have, amongst others, anti-inflammatory,  stress-reducing and/or sleep-improving effects, which might positively affect  the experience of pain. Research to disentangle the relationship between  lifestyle factors, such as physical activity level, sleep, diet, smoking, and  psychological distress, and the experience of pain in the pelvis is, therefore,  needed. Studies which address the development of management strategies for  adapting lifestyles that are specifically tailored to women with pain in the  pelvis, and as such take hormonal status, life events and context, into account,  are required. Towards clinicians, we suggest making use of the window of  opportunity to prevent a potential transition from localized or periodic pain in  the pelvis (e.g., dysmenorrhea or pain during pregnancy and after delivery)  towards persistent chronic pain, by promoting a healthy lifestyle and applying  appropriate pain management.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to identify the effects of early follicular (EF) and  midfollicular (MF) menstrual phases on body composition, resting metabolic rate  (RMR), and respiratory quotient (RQ) assessment accuracy to identify an optimal  testing period. METHODS: Body composition was obtained from a four-compartment (4C) criterion  model (fat mass (FM), fat-free mass, body fat percent, and dual-energy x-ray  absorptiometry (DXA; FM, lean mass (LM), trunk FM, and trunk LM) in 19  eumenorrheic females (mean ± SD: age, 21.3 ± 3.1 yr, body mass index, 23.6 ± 1.8  kg·m-2). RMR (kcal·d-1) and RQ (a.u.) were measured via indirect calorimetry for  25 min. Body composition, RMR, and RQ were measured during the EF and MF phases.  Dependent-samples t-tests were used to compare outcomes between EF and MF. RESULTS: 4C outcomes were similar between phases (P > 0.05). During EF, the  following 4C components were significantly greater (P < 0.05): body volume (mean  difference (MD) ± SD, 0.70 ± 1.05 L), extracellular fluid (MD ± SD, 0.27 ± 0.51  L), and body mass (MD ± SD, 0.56 ± 0.80 kg). DXA-measured LM, body fat percent,  trunk LM, and trunk FM were similar (P > 0.05); however, DXA FM was  significantly greater during EF (MD ± SD, 0.29 ± 0.40 kg; P = 0.005), yet within  measurement error of the device. Although RMR was not significantly different  between phases (MD ± SD, 6.0 ± 190.93 kcal·d-1; P > 0.05), RQ was significantly  higher during EF (mean ± SD, 0.03 ± 0.06 a.u.; P = 0.029) compared with MF. CONCLUSIONS: Body composition from 4C and DXA do not seem to be affected beyond  measurement error as a result of compartmental changes from the menstrual cycle.  During MF, women oxidized more fat as demonstrated by a lower RQ. Researchers  should aim to be more inclusive and schedule testing for females within 11-12 d  from the onset of menstruation.

BACKGROUND: The aim of the research was to determine the effect that dance has  on the promotion of health, physical well-being, as well as the emotional,  personal and social life of women who dance. In addition, the impact of the  physical activity of long, often all-night dancing events on women's health was  investigated. This included possible disturbances in their monthly cycle and  circadian rhythm, taking into account symptoms of biological rhythm  disturbances. METHODS: The study involved 214 women: tango group: 109, sedentary group: 105.  The Mann-Whitney U and chi2 tests were used to compare the groups, as well as  multiple ordinal regression to analyse individual predictors of missed menstrual  periods. RESULTS: The tango vs. sedentary groups did not differ in the duration of  menstrual bleeding, the degree of pain during menstruation, the regularity of  menstruation, the number of regular monthly cycles per year, and amenorrhea.  Intermenstrual spotting was more common in dancers (tango 12.8% vs. sedentary  4.8%; p = 0.038). The frequency of missed periods was not increased by any of  the assessed aspects. In 59.6% of female dancers, milongas caused disturbances  in circadian rhythms, including extreme fatigue and drowsiness (36.7%), 66.0% of  the dancers mentioned only positive aspects of Argentine Tango's impact on their  personal life. CONCLUSIONS: tango plays a positive and multifaceted role in the lives of  dancers and fulfils the need for social contact. The physical effort put into  this form of physical activity does not significantly affect the menstrual  cycle, and thus the reproductive functions, and can be recommended as an  attractive and safe form of physical recreation for women.

33846724,Prospective associations between physical activity and BMI with irregular periods and heavy menstrual bleeding in a large cohort of Australian women.,"Mena GP, Mielke GI, Brown WJ","1. Hum Reprod. 2021 May 17;36(6):1481-1491. doi: 10.1093/humrep/deab055.  Prospective associations between physical activity and BMI with irregular  periods and heavy menstrual bleeding in a large cohort of Australian women.  Mena GP(1), Mielke GI(1), Brown WJ(1).  Author information: (1)Centre for Research on Exercise, Physical Activity and Health, School of  Human Movement and Nutrition Sciences, The University of Queensland, Brisbane St  Lucia, QLD, Australia.  STUDY QUESTION: Are physical activity (PA) and body mass index (BMI) associated  with irregular periods and heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) in Australian women? SUMMARY ANSWER: Overweight and obese women have higher odds of both irregular  periods and HMB than underweight/normal-weight women, but high levels of PA  reduce the odds of HMB. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Most studies on relationships between PA and menstrual  problems have focused on female athletes, but there have been few  population-based studies. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Prospective cohort study, 10618 participants in  the Australian Longitudinal Study of Women's Health (ALSWH) who completed mailed  surveys in 1996, with follow-ups in 2000, 2003, 2006, 2009, 2012, and 2015. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Participants were aged 22 to 27 in  2000. They were asked to report their PA levels and the frequency of irregular  periods and HMB in each survey. BMI was calculated at every survey from  self-reported weight and height. Generalised estimating equation  population-averaged model analyses were conducted to calculate odds ratios (OR)  and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: At age 22 to 27 years, the prevalence of  irregular periods was 19.4%. This remained stable over 15 years. There were no  associations between PA and irregular periods. Overweight and obese women had  higher odds of irregular periods [overweight: OR 1.08, (95% CI 1.00-1.17);  obese: OR 1.29, (95%CI 1.18-1.41)] than women who were underweight/normal  weight.The prevalence of HMB at age 22-27 years was 15.9%; this doubled over  15 years. Women who were highly active had 10% lower odds of HMB than women who  reported no PA [OR 0.90, (95%CI 0.82-0.98)]. Overweight and obese women had  higher odds of HMB [overweight: OR 1.15, (95%CI 1.07-1.23); obese: OR 1.37,  (95%CI 1.26-1.49)] than women who were underweight/normal weight. Among obese  women, high levels of PA were associated with 19% [OR 0.81, (95%CI 0.68-0.97)]  reduction in the odds of HMB. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Data collected in the ALSWH are self-reported,  which may be subject to recall bias. Reverse causation, due to menstrual  problems impacting PA, is possible although sensitivity analyses suggest this is  unlikely to have affected the results. Other conditions, e.g., polycystic ovary  syndrome, for which no or incomplete data were available, could have affected  the results. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Intervention studies are needed to assess  the effect of increasing PA in women with HMB, but these preliminary findings  suggest that promoting PA could be an affordable and feasible strategy for  reducing HMB in young adult women. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): The ALSWH is funded by the Australian  Government. Funding for these analyses was provided by a University of  Queensland (UQ) International Postgraduate Research Scholarship and a UQ  International Development Fellowship.

BACKGROUND: Menopause is the natural termination of menstruation which affects  the quality and important aspects of women's life. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of regular resistance training (Ex) with  vitamin D (Vit. D) and calcium (Ca) supplements in the postmenopausal period on  muscle tissue in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experimental study, 72 female Wistar rats  (8-10-wk old) were randomly divided into control, placebo, Vit. D, Ca, Ex, Ca +  Vit. D, Ex + Ca, Ex + Vit. D, and Ex + Ca + Vit. D groups. Control and placebo  groups were fed with a standard diet and sesame oil, respectively. Two month  after the ovariectomy, Ex, Ca (35 mg/kg), and Vit. D (10000 IU) were administred  in all groups except the control. The number of muscle and inflammatory cells,  fiber diameter, endomysium thickness, and degenerative collagen fiber area were  assessed through hematoxylin-eosin staining. RESULTS: Muscle cell number was increased in the Ex + Vit. D + Ca, Vit. D + Ex,  and Vit. D groups compared to the control group; also, inflammatory cell number  showed significant increase in the Ex + Vit. D + Ca (12 ± 5.46), Vit. D + Ex (14  ± 3.25), Ex (13 ± 4.08), Vit. D (11 ± 3.26), Ca + Vit. D (10 ± 1.01), and Ca +  Ex (9 ± 2.87) groups. Muscle fiber diameter in the Ex + Vit. D + Ca and Vit. D +  Ex groups was higher than the other groups. Endomysium thickness was  significantly decreased in the Ex + Vit. D + Ca and Vit. D + Ex groups compared  to the control and placebo groups (p  <  0.001). Degenerative collagen fiber  area showed a significant increase in the Ex + Vit. D + Ca and Vit. D + Ex  groups (p  ≤  0.001) comparison with the control group. CONCLUSION: Regular resistance exercise, Vit. D, and Ca supplements can improve  muscle morphological features in the postmenopausal period.  Copyright © 2021 Hosseini Sisi et al.

Objectives: This study aimed to assess how menstrual cycle phase and extended  menstrual cycle length influence the incidence of injuries in international  footballers. Methods: Over a 4-year period, injuries from England international  footballers at training camps or matches were recorded, alongside self-reported  information on menstrual cycle characteristics at the point of injury. Injuries  in eumenorrheic players were categorized into early follicular, late follicular,  or luteal phase. Frequencies were also compared between injuries recorded during  the typical cycle and those that occurred after the cycle would be expected to  have finished. Injury incidence rates (per 1,000 person days) and injury  incidence rate ratios were calculated for each phase for all injuries and  injuries stratified by type. Results: One hundred fifty-six injuries from 113  players were eligible for analysis. Injury incidence rates per 1,000 person-days  were 31.9 in the follicular, 46.8 in the late follicular, and 35.4 in the luteal  phase, resulting in injury incidence rate ratios of 1.47 (Late  follicular:Follicular), 1.11 (Luteal:Follicular), and 0.76 (Luteal:Late  follicular). Injury incident rate ratios showed that muscle and tendon injury  rates were 88% greater in the late follicular phase compared to the follicular  phase, with muscle rupture/tear/strain/cramps and tendon injuries/ruptures  occurring over twice as often during the late follicular phase compared to other  phases 20% of injuries were reported as occurring when athletes were ""overdue""  menses. Conclusion: Muscle and tendon injuries occurred almost twice as often in  the late follicular phase compared to the early follicular or luteal phase.  Injury risk may be elevated in typically eumenorrheic women in the days after  their next menstruation was expected to start.  Copyright © 2021 Martin, Timmins, Cowie, Alty, Mehta, Tang and Varley.

(2)English Institute of Sport, Loughborough, UK. (3)School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences, National Centre for Sport and  Exercise Medicine, Loughborough University, Loughborough, UK.  N.C.Bishop@lboro.ac.uk.  PURPOSE: Asprosin, an orexigenic hormone that stimulates hepatic glucose  release, is elevated in insulin resistance and associated with obesity. Plasma  asprosin concentrations may also be related to female sex hormone levels; higher  levels are reported in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) but this may  be related to peripheral insulin resistance also associated with PCOS.  Clarification of female-specific factors influence on the plasma asprosin  response is crucial for studies investigating asprosin. Therefore, this study  determined the association of menstrual phase, oral contraceptive (OC) use (as a  pharmacological influence on sex hormone levels) and training status (as a  physiological influence on sex hormone levels) on plasma asprosin levels in  pre-menopausal women. METHODS: Fasting plasma asprosin, 17β-estradiol (E2) and progesterone, were  assessed in 32 healthy untrained and trained women with regular menstrual cycles  (non-OC; n = 8 untrained, n = 6 trained) or using OC (n = 10 untrained, n = 8  trained) during early follicular, late follicular and mid-luteal menstrual  phases (or the time-period equivalent for OC users). RESULTS: Asprosin was lower in OC (0.75 ± 0.38 ng mL-1) than non-OC users  (1.00 ± 0.37 ng mL-1; p = 0.022). Across a cycle, asprosin was highest in the  early follicular equivalent time-point in OC users (0.87 ± 0.37 ng mL-1) but  highest in the mid-luteal phase in non-OC users (1.09 ± 0.40 ng mL-1). Asprosin  concentrations varied more across a cycle in untrained than trained women, with  higher concentrations in the early follicular phase compared to the late  follicular and mid-luteal (training status-by-menstrual phase interaction  p = 0.028). CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the importance of considering OC use,  menstrual cycle phase and to a lesser extent training status when investigating  circulating asprosin concentrations in females.

Hum Reprod Update. 2021 Jan 4;27(1):130-153. doi: 10.1093/humupd/dmaa032.  Recovery of menses after functional hypothalamic amenorrhoea: if, when and why.  Pape J(1), Herbison AE(2), Leeners B(1)(3).  Author information: (1)Department of Reproductive Endocrinology, University Hospital Zurich, 8091  Zurich, Switzerland. (2)Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of  Cambridge CB2 3EG, UK. (3)University of Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland.  BACKGROUND: Prolonged amenorrhoea occurs as a consequence of functional  hypothalamic amenorrhoea (FHA) which is most often induced by weight loss,  vigorous exercise or emotional stress. Unfortunately, removal of these triggers  does not always result in the return of menses. The prevalence and conditions  underlying the timing of return of menses vary strongly and some women report  amenorrhoea several years after having achieved and maintained normal weight  and/or energy balance. A better understanding of these factors would also allow  improved counselling in the context of infertility. Although BMI, percentage  body fat and hormonal parameters are known to be involved in the initiation of  the menstrual cycle, their role in the physiology of return of menses is  currently poorly understood. We summarise here the current knowledge on the  epidemiology and physiology of return of menses. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: The aim of this review was to provide an overview of  (i) factors determining the recovery of menses and its timing, (ii) how such  factors may exert their physiological effects and (iii) whether there are useful  therapeutic options to induce recovery. SEARCH METHODS: We searched articles published in English, French or German  language containing keywords related to return of menses after FHA published in  PubMed between 1966 and February 2020. Manuscripts reporting data on either the  epidemiology or the physiology of recovery of menses were included and  bibliographies were reviewed for further relevant literature. The Strengthening  the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) criteria served  to assess quality of observational studies. OUTCOMES: Few studies investigate return of menses and most of them have serious  qualitative and methodological limitations. These include (i) the lack of  precise definitions for FHA or resumption of menses, (ii) the use of short  observation periods with unsatisfactory descriptions and (iii) the inclusion of  poorly characterised small study groups. The comparison of studies is further  hampered by very inhomogeneous study designs. Consequently, the exact prevalence  of resumption of menses after FHA is unknown. Also, the timepoint of return of  menses varies strongly and reliable prediction models are lacking. While weight,  body fat and energy availability are associated with the return of menses,  psychological factors also have a strong impact on the menstrual cycle and on  behaviour known to increase the risk of FHA. Drug therapies with metreleptin or  naltrexone might represent further opportunities to increase the chances of  return of menses, but these require further evaluation. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: Although knowledge on the physiology of return of menses is  presently rudimentary, the available data indicate the importance of BMI/weight  (gain), energy balance and mental health. The physiological processes and  genetics underlying the impact of these factors on the return of menses require  further research. Larger prospective studies are necessary to identify clinical  parameters for accurate prediction of return of menses as well as reliable  therapeutic options.  © The Author(s) 2020.

To determine the prevalence of menstrual dysfunction (MD; ie, oligomenorrhea or  amenorrhea) and attitudes toward body weight among athletes and non-athletes, we  studied a cohort of athletes and non-athletes, in adolescence (14-16 years) and  subsequently in young adulthood (18-20 years). We further studied the  differences between athletes reporting MD and eumenorrheic athletes at both time  periods and identified physical and behavioral characteristics that might  predict MD in young adulthood. Data were collected using questionnaires,  accelerometers, and a pre-participation screening. In adolescence, the athletes  reported current primary amenorrhea more often than the non-athletes (4.7% vs  0%, P = .03). In young adulthood, athletes reported MD more frequently than  non-athletes (38.7% vs 5.6%, P < .001). Athletes had less desire than  non-athletes to lose weight at both time points, and in adolescence, athletes  were more satisfied with their weight. However, about one fifth of the athletes  and about 40% of the non-athletes experienced body weight dissatisfaction at  both time points. In adolescence, athletes reporting MD had lower BMI than  eumenorrheic athletes. In young adulthood, athletes with MD were more physically  active than eumenorrheic athletes. The only longitudinal predictor of MD in  young adulthood was MD in adolescence. Our findings indicate that MD is  relatively frequent among young Finnish athletes. However, athletes appear to  have a smaller tendency to experience body weight dissatisfaction than their  non-athletic peers. MD seems to track from adolescence to adulthood, suggesting  that there is a need to focus on possible causes at the earliest feasible phase  of an athlete's career.  © 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and severity of menopausal symptoms and  their related risk factors among middle-aged Korean women according to their  reproductive stages. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 3039 Korean women, aged 45-65  years, who attended their routine health checkup. Their scores from the  Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) were compared and participants were categorized  into four groups according to stage of menopause: premenopause, early menopause  (≤2 years from their last menstruation), mid-menopause (2-8 years), and late  menopause (>8 years). RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 52.81 ± 5.39 years, and 98.5 % of  them reported one or more symptoms included in the MRS. The most common symptom  was physical/mental exhaustion, experienced by 86.7 % of participants. The  prevalence of moderate to severe symptoms, including vasomotor symptoms, heart  discomfort, sleep problems, sexual problems, vaginal dryness, and joint/muscular  discomfort, increased in the early menopausal period. This increased in the late  menopausal period compared with its prevalence at premenopause. The prevalence  of moderate to severe psychological symptoms, heart discomfort, and sleep  problems followed a U-shaped trend after menopause: high at early menopause, low  at mid-menopause, and high again at late menopause. A low level of physical  exercise was an independent risk factor for a high total MRS score; however, the  menopausal stages, age, and weight were also variously associated with  menopausal symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Several menopausal symptoms remain severe, or are aggravated, until  the late menopausal period among Korean women. More attention is warranted to  manage these symptoms in postmenopausal women.  Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Female Athlete Triad Coalition cumulative risk assessment tool: proposed  alternative scoring strategies.  Koltun KJ(1)(1), Williams NI(1)(1), De Souza MJ(1)(1).  Author information: (1)Women's Health and Exercise Lab, Department of Kinesiology, College of Health  and Human Development, The Pennsylvania State University, PA 16803, USA.  We (i) identified alternative scoring strategies for the Female Athlete Triad  Coalition cumulative risk assessment (CRA) tool to be utilized when particular  risk factors (bone mineral density (BMD), oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea) cannot be  determined; (ii) objectively defined dietary restriction for use in the CRA  tool; and (iii) explored proxy measures of energy deficiency. This  cross-sectional investigation of exercising women (n = 166) utilized an existing  database derived from multiple studies designed to assess health, exercise, and  menstrual function. Data from the screening/baseline period of each study  included: anthropometrics, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, disordered eating  questionnaires, descriptive data, and proxy measures of energy deficiency (total  triiodothyronine (TT3) and ratio of measured-to-predicted resting metabolic rate  (mRMR/pRMR)). Substituting delayed menarche for BMD was the best-fit replacement  resulting in 15 (9%) participants being categorized in different clearance  categories. When menstrual status cannot be assessed, such as during hormonal  contraceptive use, low energy availability (EA) determined using self-report and  disordered eating questionnaires was the best substitution, resulting in 34  (20%) participants being categorized in different clearance categories. Based on  original clearance categorizations, the provisional group had lower TT3 (78.3 ±  2.2 ng/dL; 92.7 ± 2.7 ng/dL) and Harris-Benedict mRMR/pRMR (0.85 ± 0.01; 0.90 ±  0.01) than the full group. Until an updated risk assessment tool is developed,  delayed menarche can substitute for low BMD and low EA for  oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea. Novelty This investigation addresses previous  limitations of the Triad CRA tool. Disordered eating questionnaires can be used  to objectively identify dietary restriction for the low EA risk factor. When a  risk factor cannot be assessed, delayed menarche can substitute for low BMD and  low EA for oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea.  DOI: 10.1139/apnm-2020-0131 PMID: 32502379 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the current body of research that has  investigated changes in strength-related variables during different phases of  the menstrual cycle in eumenorrheic women. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: A literature search was conducted in Pubmed, SPORTDiscus and Web of  Science using search terms related to the menstrual cycle and strength-related  measures. Two reviewers reached consensus that 21 studies met the criteria for  inclusion. Methodological rigour was assessed using the Quality Assessment Tool  for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies. Random effects  meta-analyses were used to compare the early-follicular, ovulatory and  mid-luteal phases for maximal voluntary contraction, isokinetic peak torque, and  explosive strength. RESULTS: The assessment of study quality showed that a high level of bias exists  in specific areas of study design. Non-significant and small or trivial effect  sizes (p≥0.26, Hedges g≤0.35) were identified for all strength-related variables  in each comparison between phases. 95% confidence intervals for each comparison  suggested the uncertainty associated with each estimate extends to a small  effect on strength performance with unclear direction (-0.42≤g≤0.48). The  heterogeneity for each comparison was also small (p≥0.83, I2=0%). CONCLUSIONS: Strength-related measures appear to be minimally altered (g≤0.35)  by the fluctuations in ovarian sex hormones that occur during the menstrual  cycle. This finding should be interpreted with caution due to the methodological  shortcomings identified by the quality assessment.  Copyright © 2020 Sports Medicine Australia. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

INTRODUCTION: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder in  women of reproductive age and the leading cause of anovulatory infertility.  Women with PCOS have a 15-fold higher prevalence of infertility, compared with  women without PCOS, independent of body mass index (BMI). A healthy lifestyle is  recommended to improve overall health and fertility in PCOS but there is limited  evidence on the isolated effects of exercise, especially for reproductive  outcomes. Previous findings indicate superior metabolic health benefits after  vigorous compared with moderate-intensity exercise. Our primary aim is to  determine the effect of high-intensity interval training (HIT) on menstrual  frequency, as a proxy of reproductive function, in women with PCOS. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study is a two-centre, randomised, controlled trial  with three parallel groups. Women (n=64) from Trondheim (Norway) and Melbourne  (Australia) with PCOS according to the Rotterdam criteria will be randomly  allocated (1:1:1) to high-volume HIT, low-volume HIT or a control group with no  exercise after stratifying for BMI < or ≥ 27 kg/m2 and study centre.  Measurements for study end points will be undertaken at baseline, after a  16 week exercise intervention and at 12 months following baseline assessments.  The primary outcome measure is menstruation frequency, measured as the number of  self-reported menstrual bleedings divided by the number of expected menstrual  bleedings during a 12-month period. Secondary outcome measurements include  markers of cardiovascular, metabolic and reproductive health, as well as quality  of life and adherence to and enjoyment of exercise. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Regional Committee Medical Research Ethics,  Norway, and The Australian Catholic University Human Research Ethics Committee,  Australia, have approved the trial protocol. This trial will provide new insight  regarding the impact of exercise on fertility in PCOS. We expect this trial to  contribute to new therapeutic exercise strategies as part of clinical care for  women with PCOS.

J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2020 Jan 1;105(1):185-93. doi: 10.1210/clinem/dgz030.  Energy Availability Is Associated With Luteinizing Hormone Pulse Frequency and  Induction of Luteal Phase Defects.  Koltun KJ(1), De Souza MJ(1), Scheid JL(1), Williams NI(1).  Author information: (1)Women's Health and Exercise Laboratory, Department of Kinesiology, The  Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania.  OBJECTIVE: Determine the interrelations between reductions in energy  availability (EA), luteinizing hormone (LH) pulse frequency, and the induction  of menstrual disturbances in previously sedentary, ovulatory women. METHODS: Secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial consisting of a  3-month controlled diet and supervised exercise program. EA was calculated daily  by measured energy intake (kcal) and exercise energy expenditure (kcal)  normalized to fat-free mass (kg) and averaged during baseline and each of 3  intervention menstrual cycles. Blood samples were obtained every 10 minutes for  24 hours in the early follicular phase before the intervention and after 3  months of diet and exercise (n = 14). LH pulse dynamics were assessed by  Cluster. Linear mixed models determined whether EA predicts LH pulse frequency  and LH pulse frequency predicts luteal phase defects (LPDs). RESULTS: Subjects were 20 ± 1 years old, 165.1 ± 1.4 cm tall, and weighed 58.9 ±  1.5 kg. LH pulse frequency decreased from 0.82 ± 0.06 pulses/h to 0.63 ± 0.09  pulses/h (P = 0.048) as a result of the intervention which produced modest (-3.2  ± 0.6 kg) weight loss. EA, averaged across a menstrual cycle, predicted LH pulse  frequency (P = 0.003) such that a single-unit decrease in EA was associated with  a 0.017 pulses/h decrease in LH pulse frequency. LH pulse frequency in cycles  with LPDs was 49% of that observed in cycles with no menstrual disturbances and  for every 0.1-unit decrease in LH pulse frequency, the odds of having an LPD  were 22× greater than having an optimal ovulatory cycle (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Modest reductions in EA over a prolonged period are associated with  decreased LH pulse frequency and the induction of menstrual disturbances.  © Endocrine Society 2019.

BACKGROUND: Exercise has a number of health benefits and has been recommended as  a treatment for primary dysmenorrhoea (period pain), but the evidence for its  effectiveness on primary dysmenorrhoea is unclear. This review examined the  available evidence supporting the use of exercise to treat primary  dysmenorrhoea. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of exercise for women with  primary dysmenorrhoea. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility specialised  register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, AMED and CINAHL (from inception to  July 2019). We searched two clinical trial databases (inception to March 2019)  and handsearched reference lists and previous systematic reviews. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included studies if they randomised women with  moderate-to-severe primary dysmenorrhoea to receive exercise versus no  treatment, attention control, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or  the oral contraceptive pill. Cross-over studies and cluster-randomised trials  were not eligible for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected the  studies, assessed eligible studies for risk of bias, and extracted data from  each study. We contacted study authors for missing information. We assessed the  quality of the evidence using GRADE. Our primary outcomes were menstrual pain  intensity and adverse events. Secondary outcomes included overall menstrual  symptoms, usage of rescue analgesic medication, restriction of daily life  activities, absence from work or school and quality of life. MAIN RESULTS: We included a total of 12 trials with 854 women in the review,  with 10 trials and 754 women in the meta-analysis. Nine of the 10 studies  compared exercise with no treatment, and one study compared exercise with  NSAIDs. No studies compared exercise with attention control or with the oral  contraceptive pill. Studies used low-intensity exercise (stretching, core  strengthening or yoga) or high-intensity exercise (Zumba or aerobic training);  none of the included studies used resistance training.Exercise versus no  treatmentExercise may have a large effect on reducing menstrual pain intensity  compared to no exercise (standard mean difference (SMD) -1.86, 95% confidence  interval (CI) -2.06 to -1.66; 9 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), n = 632;  I2= 91%; low-quality evidence). This SMD corresponds to a 25 mm reduction on a  100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) and is likely to be clinically significant.  We are uncertain if there is any difference in adverse event rates between  exercise and no treatment.We are uncertain if exercise reduces overall menstrual  symptoms (as measured by the Moos Menstrual Distress Questionnaire (MMDQ)), such  as back pain or fatigue compared to no treatment (mean difference (MD) -33.16,  95% CI -40.45 to -25.87; 1 RCT, n = 120; very low-quality evidence), or improves  mental quality of life (MD 4.40, 95% CI 1.59 to 7.21; 1 RCT, n = 55; very  low-quality evidence) or physical quality of life (as measured by the 12-Item  Short Form Health Survey (SF-12)) compared to no exercise (MD 3.40, 95% CI -1.68  to 8.48; 1 RCT, n = 55; very low-quality evidence) when compared to no  treatment. No studies reported on any changes in restriction of daily life  activities or on absence from work or school.Exercise versus NSAIDsWe are  uncertain if exercise, when compared with mefenamic acid, reduced menstrual pain  intensity (MD -7.40, 95% CI -8.36 to -6.44; 1 RCT, n = 122; very low-quality  evidence), use of rescue analgesic medication (risk ratio (RR) 1.77, 95% CI 1.21  to 2.60; 1 RCT, n = 122; very low-quality evidence) or absence from work or  school (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.03; 1 RCT, n = 122; very low-quality  evidence). None of the included studies reported on adverse events, overall  menstrual symptoms, restriction of daily life activities or quality of life. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The current low-quality evidence suggests that exercise,  performed for about 45 to 60 minutes each time, three times per week or more,  regardless of intensity, may provide a clinically significant reduction in  menstrual pain intensity of around 25 mm on a 100 mm VAS. All studies used  exercise regularly throughout the month, with some studies asking women not to  exercise during menstruation. Given the overall health benefits of exercise, and  the relatively low risk of side effects reported in the general population,  women may consider using exercise, either alone or in conjunction with other  modalities, such as NSAIDs, to manage menstrual pain. It is unclear if the  benefits of exercise persist after regular exercise has stopped or if they are  similar in women over the age of 25. Further research is required, using  validated outcome measures, adequate blinding and suitable comparator groups  reflecting current best practice or accounting for the extra attention given  during exercise.

Herlinga - Grudzińskiego Street 1, 30-705, Kraków,  Poland.  BACKGROUND: Rigorous exercise undertaken by young girls, combined with a  negative energetic balance, is related to substantial physiological changes in a  competitor's body, often leading to hormonal imbalance manifested by: delayed  puberty, delayed menstruation, menstrual disorders, and even long-term secondary  amenorrhoea. Very lean competitors, with insufficient body fat content, are not  capable of maintaining oestrogen production at an optimal level, which results  in hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis abnormalities and menstrual disorders.  Studies involving research on menstrual disorders in amateur dancers are scarce.  Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate whether menstrual disorders  are present among young amateur dancers. METHODS: The study involved 233 females of a mean age of 22.1 years (SD ± 4.9),  training amateur ballroom dancing. The questionnaire included questions  regarding the regularity of the menstrual cycle, including the absence of a  menstrual period, causes of menstrual disorders and breakthrough bleeding. RESULTS: Menstrual disorders following a period of regular menstruation were  reported by 132 (56.7%) of ballroom dancers. In 105 (79.5%), the absence of a  menstrual period lasted for less than 3 months, in 18 (13.6%) it persisted for 3  up to 6 months, while in 9 (6.8%) it lasted for over 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: The research conducted concluded that with an increased number of  hours spent in training by amateur dancers, there was a statistically  significant increase in the chance for menstrual disorders; the more training  sessions per week there were, the longer the breaks in menstruation were noted.

Acupuncture for polycystic ovarian syndrome.  Lim CED(1), Ng RWC, Cheng NCL, Zhang GS, Chen H.  Author information: (1)Faculty of Science, University of Technology Sydney, C/O Specialist Medical  Services Group, 356 Homer Street, Earlwood, New South Wales, Australia, 2206.  Update of     Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2016 May 03;(5):CD007689. doi:  10.1002/14651858.CD007689.pub3.  BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is characterised by the clinical  signs of oligo-amenorrhoea, infertility and hirsutism. Conventional treatment of  PCOS includes a range of oral pharmacological agents, lifestyle changes and  surgical modalities. Beta-endorphin is present in the follicular fluid of both  normal and polycystic ovaries. It was demonstrated that the beta-endorphin  levels in ovarian follicular fluid of otherwise healthy women who were  undergoing ovulation were much higher than the levels measured in plasma. Given  that acupuncture impacts on beta-endorphin production, which may affect  gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion, it is postulated that  acupuncture may have a role in ovulation induction via increased beta-endorphin  production effecting GnRH secretion. This is an update of our previous review  published in 2016. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture treatment for  oligo/anovulatory women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) for both  fertility and symptom control. SEARCH METHODS: We identified relevant studies from databases including the  Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase,  PsycINFO, CNKI, CBM and VIP. We also searched trial registries and reference  lists from relevant papers. CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CNKI and VIP  searches are current to May 2018. CBM database search is to November 2015. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that studied  the efficacy of acupuncture treatment for oligo/anovulatory women with PCOS. We  excluded quasi- or pseudo-RCTs. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected the  studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We calculated risk ratios  (RR), mean difference (MD), standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95%  confidence intervals (CIs). Primary outcomes were live birth rate, multiple  pregnancy rate and ovulation rate, and secondary outcomes were clinical  pregnancy rate, restored regular menstruation period, miscarriage rate and  adverse events. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE methods. MAIN RESULTS: We included eight RCTs with 1546 women. Five RCTs were included in  our previous review and three new RCTs were added in this update of the review.  They compared true acupuncture versus sham acupuncture (three RCTs), true  acupuncture versus relaxation (one RCT), true acupuncture versus clomiphene (one  RCT), low-frequency electroacupuncture versus physical exercise or no  intervention (one RCT) and true acupuncture versus Diane-35 (two RCTs). Studies  that compared true acupuncture versus Diane-35 did not measure fertility  outcomes as they were focused on symptom control.Seven of the studies were at  high risk of bias in at least one domain.For true acupuncture versus sham  acupuncture, we could not exclude clinically relevant differences in live birth  (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.24; 1 RCT, 926 women; low-quality evidence); multiple  pregnancy rate (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.45; 1 RCT, 926 women; low-quality  evidence); ovulation rate (SMD 0.02, 95% CI -0.15 to 0.19, I2 = 0%; 2 RCTs, 1010  women; low-quality evidence); clinical pregnancy rate (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82 to  1.29; I2 = 0%; 3 RCTs, 1117 women; low-quality evidence) and miscarriage rate  (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.56; 1 RCT, 926 women; low-quality evidence).Number of  intermenstrual days may have improved in participants receiving true acupuncture  compared to sham acupuncture (MD -312.09 days, 95% CI -344.59 to -279.59; 1 RCT,  141 women; low-quality evidence).True acupuncture probably worsens adverse  events compared to sham acupuncture (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.31; I2 = 0%; 3  RCTs, 1230 women; moderate-quality evidence).No studies reported data on live  birth rate and multiple pregnancy rate for the other comparisons: physical  exercise or no intervention, relaxation and clomiphene. Studies including  Diane-35 did not measure fertility outcomes.We were uncertain whether  acupuncture improved ovulation rate (measured by ultrasound three months post  treatment) compared to relaxation (MD 0.35, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.56; 1 RCT, 28  women; very low-quality evidence) or Diane-35 (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.87 to 2.42; 1  RCT, 58 women; very low-quality evidence).Overall evidence ranged from very low  quality to moderate quality. The main limitations were failure to report  important clinical outcomes and very serious imprecision. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: For true acupuncture versus sham acupuncture we cannot  exclude clinically relevant differences in live birth rate, multiple pregnancy  rate, ovulation rate, clinical pregnancy rate or miscarriage. Number of  intermenstrual days may improve in participants receiving true acupuncture  compared to sham acupuncture. True acupuncture probably worsens adverse events  compared to sham acupuncture.No studies reported data on live birth rate and  multiple pregnancy rate for the other comparisons: physical exercise or no  intervention, relaxation and clomiphene. Studies including Diane-35 did not  measure fertility outcomes as the women in these trials did not seek  fertility.We are uncertain whether acupuncture improves ovulation rate (measured  by ultrasound three months post treatment) compared to relaxation or Diane-35.  The other comparisons did not report on this outcome.Adverse events were  recorded in the acupuncture group for the comparisons physical exercise or no  intervention, clomiphene and Diane-35. These included dizziness, nausea and  subcutaneous haematoma. Evidence was very low quality with very wide CIs and  very low event rates.There are only a limited number of RCTs in this area,  limiting our ability to determine effectiveness of acupuncture for PCOS.

OBJECTIVE: This population-based study on school-aged girls aimed to estimate  the rate of peri-menstrual headache, evaluate headache pain pattern during the  menstrual cycle, and verify its relationships with physical, psychosocial and  life-style factors. METHODS: The students (n = 4973) fulfilled a self-administered questionnaire on  demographic and behavioral characteristics, menarche, menstrual pattern and  features including headache and dysmenorrhea. The prevalence of headache and the  mean pain intensity score at the three menstrual cycle phases (premenstrual,  menstrual, in-between period) were estimated, both overall and by gynecological  year. Furthermore, the prevalence of three different patterns of headache (peri  menstrual/mid-cycle/acyclic) was evaluated, together with the mean pain  intensity score. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of headache at least once at any time during the  menstrual cycle was 64.4%. At multivariable logistic analysis, gynecological age  (OR 1.07; 95%CI 1.03-1.12), middle social level (1.24; 1.01-1.55, compared to  high social level), physical activity (0.67; 0.51-0.89), oral contraceptive use  (1.34; 1.04-1.73) and dysmenorrhea (2.30; 1.54-3.42) were significantly  associated with headache. Among girls with headache, 83.4% had peri-menstrual  headache (44.6% premenstrual, 38.8% menstrual), 3.5% mid-cycle headache and  13.2% acyclic headache. The gynaecological age and dysmenorrhea were  significantly associated with the headache pattern (p = 0.03 and p < 0.0001,  respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that peri-menstrual headache is highly  prevalent among adolescents. In girls, the headache rate linearly raises with  higher gynecological age; menses-related painful syndromes, such as headache and  dysmenorrhea, are strongly interrelated. The anamnesis and monitoring of  menstrual health should be mandatory when taking care of girls with headache.  DOI: 10.1007/s12098-018-2829-3 PMID: 30637681 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Triggers, Protectors, and Predictors in Episodic Migraine.  Marmura MJ(1).  Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, Jefferson Headache Clinic, Thomas Jefferson  University, Philadelphia, PA, USA. Michael.marmura@jefferson.edu.  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: A wide variety of triggers prompt attacks in episodic  migraine. Although experimental triggers such as glyceryl trinitrate reliably  produce migraine, natural triggers are much less predictable and vary in  importance between individuals. This review describes the most common triggers  in episodic migraine and provides strategies for managing them in clinical  practice. RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple migraine attack triggers have been established based  on patient surveys, diary studies, and clinical trials. Stress, menstrual cycle  changes, weather changes, sleep disturbances, alcohol, and other foods are among  the most common factors mentioned. Clinical studies have verified that fasting,  premenstrual periods in women, ""letdown"" after stress, and most likely low  barometric pressures are migraine triggers. Premonitory symptoms such as neck  pain, fatigue, and sensitivity to lights, sounds, or odors may mimic triggers.  Multiple studies clearly demonstrate triggers in episodic migraine, often  related to change in homeostasis or environment. Many common migraine triggers  are not easily modifiable, and avoiding triggers may not be realistic. Healthy  lifestyle choices such as exercise, adequate sleep, stress management, and  eating regularly may prevent triggers and transformation to chronic migraine  over time.

PURPOSE: We aimed to explore the effects of low energy availability  (EA)[15 kcal·kg lean body mass (LBM)-1·d-1] achieved by diet or exercise on bone  turnover markers in active, eumenorrheic women. METHODS: By using a crossover design, ten eumenorrheic women (VO2 peak:  48.1 ± 3.3 ml·kg-1·min-1) completed all three, 3-day conditions in a randomised  order: controlled EA (CON; 45 kcal·kgLBM-1·d-1), low EA through dietary energy  restriction (D-RES; 15 kcal·kgLBM-1·d-1) and low EA through increasing exercise  energy expenditure (E-RES; 15 kcal·kgLBM-1·d-1), during the follicular phase of  three menstrual cycles. In CON, D-RES and E-RES, participants consumed diets  providing 45, 15 and 45 kcal·kgLBM-1·d-1. In E-RES only, participants completed  supervised running sessions (129 ± 10 min·d-1) at 70% of their VO2 peak that  resulted in an exercise energy expenditure of 30 kcal·kg LBM-1·d-1. Blood  samples were collected at baseline (BASE) and at the end of the 3-day period  (D6) and analysed for bone turnover markers (β-CTX and P1NP), markers of calcium  metabolism (PTH, albumin-adjusted Ca, Mg and PO4) and hormones (IGF-1, T3,  insulin, leptin and 17β-oestradiol). RESULTS: In D-RES, P1NP concentrations at D6 decreased by 17% (BASE:  54.8 ± 12.7 μg·L-1, D6: 45.2 ± 9.3 μg·L-1, P < 0.001, d = 0.91) and were lower  than D6 concentrations in CON (D6: 52.5 ± 11.9 μg·L-1, P = 0.001). P1NP did not  change significantly in E-RES (BASE: 55.3 ± 14.4 μg·L-1, D6: 50.9 ± 15.8 μg·L-1,  P = 0.14). β-CTX concentrations did not change following D-RES (BASE:  0.48 ± 0.18 μg·L-1, D6: 0.55 ± 0.17 μg·L-1) or E-RES (BASE: 0.47 ± 0.24 μg·L-1,  D6: 0.49 ± 0.18 μg·L-1) (condition × time interaction effect, P = 0.17). There  were no significant differences in P1NP (P = 0.25) or β-CTX (P = 0.13) responses  between D-RES and E-RES. Both conditions resulted in reductions in IGF-1 (-13%  and - 23% from BASE in D-RES and E-RES, both P < 0.01) and leptin (-59%  and - 61% from BASE in D-RES and E-RES, both P < 0.001); T3 decreased in D-RES  only (-15% from BASE, P = 0.002) and PO4 concentrations decreased in E-RES only  (-9%, P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Low EA achieved through dietary energy restriction resulted in a  significant decrease in bone formation but no change in bone resorption, whereas  low EA achieved through exercise energy expenditure did not significantly  influence bone metabolism. Both low EA conditions elicited significant and  similar changes in hormone concentrations.  Crown Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

(3)Department of Midwifery, Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery, Isfahan University  of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.  BACKGROUND: Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is the emergence of periodic one or more  symptoms of symptoms before menstruation and in the first few days of  menstruation. Lifestyle is one of the series of factors that affect the health  of people. Activity, smoking, and food intake are factors associated with  lifestyle, and evidence suggests that women and girls with PMS do not have an  adequate life span. The aim of this study was to determine the factors  associated with PMS in female high school students. METHODS: This cross-sectional correlation study was conducted in 200 female high  school students in Sabzevar city using multistage random sampling in the  academic year of 2016-2017. Data gathering tools include the temporary  diagnostic questionnaire of the PMS, and Beck Depression questionnaire; the  nonresonant tape was accurate to 0.1 cm and the digital scale was accurate to  0.1 kg. We analyzed the data using SPSS software and Mann-Whitney U-test. RESULTS: The results of this study showed that there is a significant  relationship between PMS and fried foods (P = 0.017), sweet drink (P = 0.018),  fast food (P = 0.048), fruit (P = 0.012), no habitual exercise (P = 0.006),  family history of PMS (P = 0.002), hip circumference (P = 0.04), and body mass  index (P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: There is a relationship between PMS and some anthropometric indices  and nutritional/metabolic factors. Therefore, having a proper lifestyle is  effective in reducing PMS.

(2)Department of Radiodiagnosis, Government Medical College, Trivandrum, Kerala,  India. (3)Department of General Surgery, Government Medical College, Trivandrum,  Kerala, India.  BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among females all over  the world. The incidence of breast cancer is persistently on the rise due to  urbanization and lifestyle changes. Although various risk factors have been  suggested for estimating the risk of developing breast cancer, most of these  have been studied in the Western population. A better understanding of local  characteristics of risk factors may help in devising locally effective  prevention strategies for breast cancer. The primary objective of the study was  to study the risk factors for carcinoma breast among Indian women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a case-control study, conducted from January  2011 to December 2012, at a tertiary level teaching institution. A total of 100  patients of Indian origin, attending the General Surgery Department with  carcinoma breast during this period were the cases. Controls were the blood  relatives of patients with other diagnosed malignancies. RESULTS: The major risk factors for breast cancer are found to be age, diet,  waist size, hip size, waist-hip ratio (WHR), body mass index, high-density  lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, more than three pregnancies, number of  years of menstruation, atypical hyperplasia in the previous biopsy, and history  of carcinoma in relatives. CONCLUSIONS: Waist size and WHR are the major risk factors for carcinoma of  breast. Adequate exercise and weight control are the most effective lifestyle  changes that can reduce the risk of developing breast cancer.

(2)Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, Gold Coast,  Queensland, Australia. (3)Queensland Academy of Sport Centre of Excellence for Applied Sport Science  Research, Nathan, Queensland, Australia.  We sought to determine whether oral contraception alters the gender-related  differences observed in the exercise pressor reflex during isometric handgrip  exercise. Fifteen men, fifteen normally menstruating women (WomenNM), and  fifteen women taking monophasic oral contraceptives (WomenOC) completed two  trials of a 3-min isometric handgrip exercise protocol performed at 30% of their  maximal voluntary contraction: (1) where arterial occlusion was applied to the  previously exercising arm during a 3-min recovery period (Occlusion trial); (2)  where no arterial occlusion was applied during recovery (Control trial).  Handgrip exercise elicited greater increases in mean arterial pressure (MAP) in  MEN compared to both female groups (P < 0.05), and in WomenOC compared to  WomenNM in both trials (P = 0.01, P = 0.03). After 3 min of recovery, sBP was  12% (P = 0.01) and 9% (P = 0.02) higher in the Occlusion trial when compared to  the Control trial for MEN and WomenOC. Conversely, arterial occlusion in  recovery from handgrip did not sustain elevated sBP in the Occlusion trial, and  sBP returned to recovery levels not different to the Control trial, in WomenNM  (P = 0.41). These data indicate that gender-related differences in the  metaboreflex during isometric handgrip exercise exist between men and normally  menstruating women, but are blunted when men are compared to women taking oral  contraceptives. We conclude that the suppression of 17β-estradiol and/or  progestogen in women via the administration of oral contraceptives attenuates  sex-related differences in the metaboreflex during isometric handgrip exercise.  © 2018 The Authors.

OBJECTIVE: To analyse the prevalence of myths pertinent to healthcare issues of  females of reproductive age. METHODS: This cross-sectional, simple descriptive, knowledge, attitude and  practices-education research was conducted at the Combined Military Hospital,  Peshawar, Pakistan, from February to August 2016. A 30-item self-designed  questionnaire was applied, collecting demographic details and answers to 21  close-ended questions encompassing the prevalence of myths pertinent to  reproductive health issues of women in Pakistan.Every question had three  options, Yes(myth), No(correct answer) and Don't Know(unsure). SPSS 21 was used  for data analysis. RESULTS: There were 594 participants in the study. The overall mean age was  35.11±12.711 years and the mean duration of education was 9.41±6.353 years.  Besides, >50% answers positive for myths and <50% answers positive for myths  were given by 326(54.9%) and 268(45.1%) respondents, respectively. The  prevalence of myths was directly proportional to age (p=0.004), and inversely  proportional to education (p<0.001) and socio-economic class(p<0.001); impact of  education was stronger than socio-economic class(Pearson's chi-square being  74.189 and 48.672, respectively). Khyber Pakhtunkhwa-based respondents harboured  more myths (p=0.024). There was no significant impact of marital status  (p=0.099). CONCLUSIONS: The participants held significant amount of myths regarding health  issues in reproductive age.  PMID: 28839310 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

PURPOSE: Oral contraceptive (OC) use reduces peak aerobic capacity (V˙O2peak);  however, whether it also influences adaptations to training has yet to be  determined. This study aimed to examine the influence of OC use on peak  performance (peak power output [PPO]) and physiological adaptations (V˙O2peak  and peak cardiac output [Q˙peak]) after sprint interval training (SIT) in  recreationally active women. METHODS: Women taking an OC (n = 25) or experiencing natural regular menstrual  cycles (MC; n = 16) completed an incremental exercise test to assess V˙O2peak,  PPO, and Q˙peak before, immediately after, and 4 wk after 12 sessions of SIT.  The SIT consisted ten 1-min efforts at 100% to 120% PPO in a 1:2 work-rest  ratio. RESULTS: Though V˙O2peak increased in both groups after SIT (both P < 0.001),  the MC group showed greater improvement (OC, +8.5%; MC, +13.0%; P = 0.010).  Similarly, Q˙peak increased in both groups, with greater improvement in the MC  group (OC, +4.0%; MC, +16.1%; P = 0.013). PPO increased in both groups (OC,  +13.1%; MC, +13.8%; NS). All parameters decreased 4 wk after SIT cessation, but  remained elevated from pretraining levels; the OC group showed more sustained  training effects in V˙O2peak (OC, -4.0%; MC, -7.7%; P = 0.010). CONCLUSION: SIT improved peak exercise responses in recreationally active women.  However, OC use dampened V˙O2peak and Q˙peak adaptation. A follow-up period  indicated that OC users had spared V˙O2peak adaptations, suggesting that OC use  may influence the time course of physiological training adaptations. Therefore,  OC use should be verified, controlled for, and considered when interpreting  physiological adaptations to exercise training in women.

Author information: (1)1College of Nursing, Mo-Im Kim Nursing Research Institute 2College of  Nursing, Yonsei University, Seoul 3Department of Sociology, Hallym University,  Chuncheon, Korea.  OBJECTIVE: Social determinants have been understudied in relation to metabolic  risk and menopause; this study aimed to identify metabolic risk factors during  menopausal transition, changes in lifestyle, and other social determinants. METHODS: The Korean Genetic Epidemiologic Survey Community cohort data available  for baseline, 2-year, and 4-year follow-up time points were analyzed. Healthy  women ages 45 to 55 years, not taking hormonal therapy, were selected; 1,228  were analyzed. Menopausal transition was categorized as premenopausal,  perimenopausal, and postmenopausal. Lifestyle patterns consisted of alcohol  consumption, exercise, ever smoking, indirect smoking, and eating breakfast.  Generalized estimating equations were used for analysis. RESULTS: During the period of study, roughly 30% had become postmenopausal and  metabolic syndrome was found in 11.5% to 14.4%. Controlling for other variables,  lower income levels showed more than 2 times greater risk for metabolic syndrome  in postmenopausal women and those who continued to menstruate. Body mass index  was a consistent factor of metabolic risk, which was more pronounced when  analyzed by menopausal status, especially in obese menstruating women (odds  ratio 30.72, P < 0.0001). Among women who experienced menopause during the  observed time frame, less education and sedentary lifestyle were also  significant factors in metabolic risk differences, showing 1.7 times and 1.59  times greater risk, respectively. Such differences in education, income, and  sedentary lifestyle as significant risk factors in subgroups according to  menstrual status change, may suggest vulnerable points in the transition. CONCLUSIONS: Implications include the need for stronger emphasis on weight  control before midlife and experiencing menopause, promoting exercise across the  menopausal transition, and supportive policy measures for economically  disadvantaged women.

STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the nature and prevalence of menstrual disorders  among teenage girls. DESIGN: An observational descriptive cross-sectional study. SETTING: Zagazig University Students' Hospital, Zagazig, Egypt. PARTICIPANTS: A representative sample of female students who attended the  university pre-enrollment medical examination. INTERVENTIONS: Self-administered questionnaire covering items on the  adolescents' demographic data and menstruation characteristics. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Information about menarche, body mass index, physical  exercise, cycle length and regularity, duration of menses, menstrual blood loss,  dysmenorrhea, and premenstrual syndrome. RESULTS: A total of 285 questionnaires were analyzed. Mean age at menarche was  12.3 ± 1.5 years. Oligomenorrhea was reported by 18 participants (6.3%) and 5  others (1.8%) mentioned having polymenorrhea. Hypomenorrhea was noted in 25  students (8.8%), and hypermenorrhea was reported by 12 (4.2%). Irregular periods  were mentioned by 24 students (8.4%). Dysmenorrhea was reported in 188 students  (66.0%). Of these, 81 (28.4%) graded their pain as mild, 69 (24.2%) as moderate,  and 38 (13.3%) as severe. Premenstrual syndrome was mentioned by 160 girls  (56.1%). Consulting somebody regarding their menstrual problems was reported by  36 students (12.6%). CONCLUSION: Our results are not greatly different from those in other parts of  the world. Data on nature and prevalence of menstrual disorders and their effect  on young women's health status, quality of life, and social integration suggest  that management of these disorders should be given more attention within the  available reproductive health care programs. Further research into prevalence of  and risk factors for menstrual disorders and their morbidity is warranted and  anxiously awaited.

AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the possible risk factors related  with osteoporosis in women with spontaneous menopause. METHODS: Five hundred and one postmenopausal women were divided into three  groups as normal, osteopenic and osteoporotic according to their bone mineral  density (BMD). By face-to-face interview, parity, age at menarche, age at  menopause, duration of fertility, duration of menopause, first pregnancy age,  total lactation period, exercise, smoking were assessed. Women with menopause  age before 40 years, surgical menopause, who had any anti-osteoporosis  treatment, hormone replacement therapy at the time of BMD measurement and  corticosteroid use longer than 6 months were excluded from the study. RESULTS: Among 501 postmenopausal women, 107 women were classified as normal,  170 as osteopenic and 224 as osteoporotic. Among demographic features of  patients, there was statistically significant difference between the groups in  age, BMI and parity (p < 0.001, p < 0.0001 and p = 0.002, respectively). There  were statistically significant differences between the groups in case of age at  menopause, duration of fertility and duration of menopause (p = 0.013, p = 0.013  and p < 0.0001, respectively). In the multivariate logistic regression analysis,  BMI over 32 and fertility duration over 33 years had a statistically significant  protective effect against osteoporosis (OR 0.42, CI 95 % 0.27-0.66; OR 0.36, CI  95 % 0.24-0.56, respectively), but age was positively correlated with  osteoporosis (OR 1.13, CI 95 % 1.01-1.17) CONCLUSIONS: Duration of fertility  (years of menstruation) longer than 33 years and body mass index higher than 32  seem to protect against postmenopausal osteoporosis. Age is also an independent  risk factor for postmenopausal osteoporosis.  DOI: 10.1007/s40520-015-0333-4 PMID: 25722061 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

BACKGROUND: Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is used to describe physical, cognitive,  affective, and behavioral symptoms that occur cyclically during the luteal phase  of the menstrual cycle and resolve quickly at or within a few days of the onset  of menstruation. The primary aim of the study was to assess the prevalence,  impacts and medical managements of PMS on female medical students of Mekelle  University College of Health Sciences. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among systematically selected  female students of Mekelle University College of Health Sciences, Mekelle town,  northern Ethiopia from March to April 2013. A structured and pretested  self-administered questionnaire was employed for data collection. The collected  data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, SPSS  Inc., Chicago, IL (SPSS version 16). The criteria proposed by the Diagnostic and  Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, text revision (DSM-IV  TR) were used to diagnose PMS. RESULT: From the total population size of 608; a sample size of 258 was drawn.  Age of the study participants ranged from 18 to 25 years, with mean age of  20.86 ± 1.913 years. Among the participants, 144(83.2%) have had at least one PM  symptoms with their menstrual period. The prevalence of PMS according to DSM-IV  was 37.0%. About 49(28.3%) reported frequent class missing, 17(9.8%) exam  missing, 14(8.1%) low grade scoring and 3(1.7%) of them reported withdrawal from  their learning associated with their PMS. Only 83(48.0%) participants sought  medical treatment for their PMS. The treatment modalities used were pain  killers, 63(36.4%), hot drinks like coffee and tea, 13(7.5%), and massage  therapy and exercise, 7(4.0%). Binary logistic regression analysis revealed  average length of one cycle of menstruation (COR = 0.20(0.070-0.569) and  academic performance impairment (AOR = 0.345(0.183-0.653) were significantly  associated with the diagnosis of PMS and use of PMS treatments respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed a high prevalence and negative impact of PMS on  students of Mekelle University. Therefore, health education, appropriate medical  treatment and counseling services, as part of the overall health service, should  be availed and provided to affected women.

CONTEXT: Puberty is a crucial period of dramatic hormonal changes, accelerated  growth, attainment of reproductive capacity, and acquisition of peak bone mass.  Participation in recreational physical activity is widely acknowledged to  provide significant health benefits in this period. Conversely, intense training  imposes several constraints, such as training stress and maintenance of very low  body fat to maximize performance. Adolescent female athletes are therefore at  risk of overtraining and/or poor dietary intake, which may have several  consequences for endocrine function. The ""adaptive"" changes in the  hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal, -adrenal, and somatotropic axes and the  secretory role of the adipose tissue are reviewed, as are their effects on  growth, menstrual cycles, and bone mass acquisition. DESIGN: A systematic search on Medline between 1990 and 2013 was conducted using  the following terms: ""intense training,"" ""physical activity,"" or ""exercise""  combined with ""hormone,"" ""endocrine,"" and ""girls,"" ""women,"" or ""elite female  athletes."" All articles reporting on the endocrine changes related to intense  training and their potential implications for growth, menstrual cycles, and bone  mass acquisition were considered. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Young female athletes present a high prevalence of  menstrual disorders, including delayed menarche, oligomenorrhea, and amenorrhea,  characterized by a high degree of variability according to the type of sport.  Exercise-related reproductive dysfunction may have consequences for growth  velocity and peak bone mass acquisition. Recent findings highlight the endocrine  role of adipose tissue and energy balance in the regulation of homeostasis and  reproductive function. A better understanding of the mechanisms whereby intense  training affects the endocrine system may orient research to develop innovative  strategies (ie, based on nutritional or pharmacological approaches and  individualized modalities of training and competition) to improve the medical  care of these adolescents and protect their reproductive function.

Autonomic Cardiovascular Damage during Post-menopause: the Role of Physical  Training.  Souza HC(1), Tezini GC.  Author information: (1)Exercise Physiology Laboratory of the Department of Biomechanics, Medicine  and Rehabilitation, School of Medicine of Ribeirão Preto, University of São  Paulo, Ribeirão Preto, Brazil.  Menopause is part of the aging process and is characterized by the natural  cessation of menstruation; during this time, the production of ovarian hormones,  especially estrogen, is sharply reduced. This reduction can cause symptoms and  disorders that affect most women and can interfere with their quality of life.  Women are also more susceptible to cardiovascular diseases during this period,  considering that these ovarian hormones would be associated with a protective  effect on the cardiovascular system, by acting at various levels, contributing  to the body homeostasis. Among several effects on the cardiovascular system, the  ovarian hormones seem to play an important role in the autonomic control of  heart rate and blood pressure. A reduction in ovarian hormones causes an  autonomic imbalance and increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases. In fact,  this increased risk is justified by the key role the autonomic nervous system  plays in all cardiac regulatory mechanisms, exerting a tonic and reflexive  influence on the main variables of the cardiovascular system. The autonomic  system controls various cardiovascular parameters, such as the modulation of  heart rate and blood pressure, myocardial contractility and venous capacitance,  directly participating in the regulation of cardiac output. Over the years, the  standard treatment for menopause symptoms and disorders has been hormone  replacement therapy (HRT). However, many studies have indicated the risks of  HRT, which justify the need for new non-pharmacological therapies. To this end,  physical training, mainly aerobic, has been applied with excellent results on  the cardiovascular autonomic nervous system, as it reduces the risk of cardiac  diseases and improves the survival rate with direct beneficial effects on the  quality of life of these women during the aging process.

Reynolds-May MF(1), Kenna HA, Marsh W, Stemmle PG, Wang P, Ketter TA, Rasgon NL.  Author information: (1)Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University School  of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.  OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present study was to investigate the reproductive  function of women with bipolar disorder (BD) compared to healthy controls. METHODS: Women diagnosed with BD and healthy controls with no psychiatric  history, aged 18-45 years, were recruited from a university clinic and  surrounding community. Participants completed a baseline reproductive health  questionnaire, serum hormone assessment, and ovulation tracking for three  consecutive cycles using urine luteinizing hormone (LH)-detecting strips with a  confirmatory luteal-phase serum progesterone. RESULTS: Women with BD (n = 103) did not differ from controls (n = 36) in  demographics, rates of menstrual abnormalities (MAs), or number of  ovulation-positive cycles. Of the women with BD, 17% reported a current MA and  39% reported a past MA. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and  17-hydroxyprogesterone levels were higher in controls (p = 0.052 and 0.004,  respectively), but there were no other differences in biochemical levels.  Medication type, dose, or duration was not associated with MA or biochemical  markers, although those currently taking an atypical antipsychotic agent  indicated a greater rate of current or past MA (80% versus 55%, p = 0.013). In  women with BD, 22% reported a period of amenorrhea associated with exercising or  stress, versus 8% of controls (p = 0.064). Self-reported rates of bulimia and  anorexia nervosa were 10% and 5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of MA and biochemical levels did not significantly differ  between women with BD and controls. Current atypical antipsychotic agent use was  associated with a higher rate of current or past MA and should be further  investigated. The incidence of stress-induced amenorrhea should be further  investigated in this population, as should the comorbid incidence of eating  disorders.  © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Author information: (1)Penn State University, Department of Kinesiology, Women's Health and Exercise  Laboratory, Noll Laboratory, University Park, PA 16802, USA. rjt199@psu.edu  Reproductive function, metabolic hormones, and lean mass have been observed to  influence bone metabolism and bone mass. It is unclear, however, if  reproductive, metabolic and body composition factors play unique roles in the  clinical measures of areal bone mineral density (aBMD) and bone geometry in  exercising women. This study compares lumbar spine bone mineral apparent density  (BMAD) and estimates of femoral neck cross-sectional moment of inertia (CSMI)  and cross-sectional area (CSA) between exercising ovulatory (Ov) and amenorrheic  (Amen) women. It also explores the respective roles of reproductive function,  metabolic status, and body composition on aBMD, lumbar spine BMAD and femoral  neck CSMI and CSA, which are surrogate measures of bone strength. Among  exercising women aged 18-30 years, body composition, aBMD, and estimates of  femoral neck CSMI and CSA were assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry.  Lumbar spine BMAD was calculated from bone mineral content and area.  Estrone-1-glucuronide (E1G) and pregnanediol glucuronide were measured in daily  urine samples collected for one cycle or monitoring period. Fasting blood  samples were collected for measurement of leptin and total triiodothyronine. Ov  (n = 37) and Amen (n = 45) women aged 22.3 ± 0.5 years did not differ in body  mass, body mass index, and lean mass; however, Ov women had significantly higher  percent body fat than Amen women. Lumbar spine aBMD and BMAD were significantly  lower in Amen women compared to Ov women (p < 0.001); however, femoral neck CSA  and CSMI were not different between groups. E1G cycle mean and age of menarche  were the strongest predictors of lumbar spine aBMD and BMAD, together explaining  25.5% and 22.7% of the variance, respectively. Lean mass was the strongest  predictor of total hip and femoral neck aBMD as well as femoral neck CSMI and  CSA, explaining 8.5-34.8% of the variance. Upon consideration of several  potential osteogenic stimuli, reproductive function appears to play a key role  in bone mass at a site composed of primarily trabecular bone. However, lean mass  is one of the most influential predictors of bone mass and bone geometry at  weight-bearing sites, such as the hip.  Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Duckham RL(1), Peirce N, Bailey CA, Summers G, Cameron N, Brooke-Wavell K.  Author information: (1)School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences, Loughborough University,  Loughborough, Leicestershire, LE11 3TU, UK. r.l.duckham@lboro.ac.uk  Athletes have higher bone mineral density (BMD) relative to nonathletes. In  amenorrheic athletes BMD may be compromised by estrogen deficiency, but it is  unknown whether this is accompanied by structural differences. We compared  femoral neck bone geometry and density of a-/oligomenorrheic athletes (AAs),  eumenorrheic athletes (EAs), and eumenorrheic controls (ECs). We recruited 156  women: (68 endurance athletes and 88 controls). Femoral neck BMD, section  modulus (Z), and width were measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.  Menstrual function was assessed by questionnaire and classified as EA (≥10  periods/year) or AA (≤9 periods/year): 24 athletes were AA and 44 EA. Femoral  neck BMD was significantly higher in EA than AA (8 %, difference) and EC (11 %  difference): mean [SE] 1.118 [0.015], 1.023 [0.020] and 0.999 [0.014] g cm(-2),  respectively; p < 0.001. Z was significantly higher in EA than EC (11 %  difference): EA 667 [19], AA 625 [21], and EC 592 [10] cm(3); p < 0.001. Femoral  neck width did not differ between groups. All differences persisted after  adjustment for height, age, and body mass. The higher femoral neck Z and BMD in  athletes, despite similar width, may indicate that exercise-related bone gains  are endosteal rather than periosteal. Athletes with amenorrhea had smaller  increments in bone mass rather than structural adaptation. The maintained  femoral neck width in controls may be an adaptive mechanism to conserve bone  strength in bending despite inactivity-related bone decrement.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore factors associated with  ""resilience"" and ""vulnerability"" to hot flushes and night sweats. METHODS: A total of 4,407 women aged 45 to 54 years who were recruited from  family practices in northeast Scotland responded to a postal questionnaire.  Among respondents reporting high-frequency hot flushes (n = 628) or night sweats  (n = 628), we compared those with low levels of bother (""resilient"") with the  rest. Similarly, among women reporting low-frequency hot flushes (n = 459) or  night sweats (n = 459), those with high bother (""vulnerable"") were compared with  the rest. Forward stepwise logistic regression examined social, psychological,  and physical factors associated with resilience or vulnerability to each  symptom. RESULTS: Women resilient to hot flushes were those who had previously not been  bothered by their menstrual periods; were not experiencing somatic symptoms or  night sweats; and perceived their symptoms as having low consequences on their  lives. Those vulnerable to hot flushes had children; had a high body mass index;  reported night sweats; and perceived their symptoms as having high life  consequences. Women resilient to night sweats were nonsmokers; were not  experiencing sleep difficulties; were not using psychological symptom management  strategies; and perceived their menopausal symptoms as having low life  consequences. Those vulnerable to night sweats had low educational attainment;  had previously been bothered by their menstrual periods; had below-average  physical health; reported musculoskeletal symptoms and hot flushes; and  perceived their menopausal symptoms as having high life consequences. CONCLUSIONS: Factors associated with resilience or vulnerability differ by  symptom studied, although relationships with illness perceptions exist in all  models. Our results suggest that a single approach to managing these symptoms is  likely to be unsuccessful.  DOI: 10.1097/gme.0b013e31827655cf PMID: 23250082 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

The exercise consisted  of the treadmill walking exercise, intensity of 50% of heart rate reserve, for  the duration of 30 minutes, at the frequency of 3 times a week, over a 3-month  period. Serum beta CTx, PINP and NMID osteocalcin were measured at the baseline  and in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd months. RESULTS: Twenty women: 11 menstruating women and 9 menopauses completed the  exercise protocol. The baseline characteristics including age, body mass index,  serum beta CTx, PINP and NMID were statistically different. The serum beta CTx  and NMID levels were decreased from the baseline from Month 1 to 3 in both  menstruating and menopausal groups. Serum PINP was not significantly changed in  the 1st and 2nd months except the significant decreasing in the 3rd month in the  menstruating women. There were no significant differences of bone marker changes  between the menstruating women and the menopauses. The biochemical bone markers'  levels (beta CTx, PINP and NMID) had the strong correlations analyzed by  Pearson's correlation coefficients (> 0.8 with p-value < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The present study clearly demonstrates that the moderate intensity  treadmill walking exercise for 30 minutes, 3 times a week reduces bone  resorption and bone turnover markers in both the menstruating women and the  menopauses after the first month until the third month of the experiment.  Although the bone formation markers had a tendency of decreasing after  exercising, the significant changes showed only in the 3rd month in the  menstruating group. All of the bone markers including beta CTx, NMID osteocalcin  and PINP were highly correlated.  PMID: 22338920 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Author information: (1)Department of General Practice, Institute for Health and Society, University  of Oslo, Oslo, Norway. bjorn.gjelsvik@medisin.uio.no  OBJECTIVES: To describe symptoms during the menopausal transition and age at  menopause in a representative Norwegian female cohort over a ten year period, to  analyze factors associated with frequency and burden of symptoms and influence  on self-rated health. STUDY DESIGN: 2229 women aged 40-44 years at inclusion, randomly selected from a  national health survey in Hordaland County, Norway, and followed with seven  postal questionnaires from 1997 throughout 2009. Data for 2002 women (90%) were  eligible for analyses. RESULTS: In a longitudinal analysis, 36% of the women reported daily hot flushes  in one or more questionnaires, whereas 29% did not experience hot flushes at  all. The prevalence of daily hot flushes increased from 2% at age 41-42 to 22%  at age 53-54, decreasing to 20% at age 55-57. The odds ratio for reporting daily  hot flushes vs. never/seldom for daily smokers was 1.6 (1.24-2.10). Women in the  lowest education group had an OR=1.8 (1.21-2.56) for reporting daily hot flushes  compared to women with a university degree. There was no relation between the  symptom burden and degree of physical exercise, overall feeling of health, BMI,  family income, parity or menarche age as recorded at baseline. The mean age for  final menstruation period (FMP) in the cohort was 51.1 (50.9-51.3) years.  Smokers had a mean age of FMP 0.9 years earlier compared to the non-smokers. CONCLUSIONS: Daily smoking and educational level were independent risk factors  for experiencing daily menopausal symptoms. Degree of physical exercise, BMI,  parity or menarche age did not have significant influence.  Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Author information: (1)Exercise Biology Laboratory (BioEx), Health Sciences Institute, Triângulo  Mineiro Federal University (UFTM), Uberaba-MG, Brazil. fabiorsatti@gmail.com  BACKGROUND: After menopause, rapid bone mass loss occurs in response to  hypoestrogenism. Several studies suggest that muscle mass and bone mineral  density (BMD) are positively associated in postmenopausal women. Therefore, it  may be assumed that postmenopausal low appendicular muscle mass (aMM) can  increase BMD loss in a short period of time. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess relationship of aMM with  femoral neck BMD in postmenopausal women. METHODS: Prospective, controlled clinical Trial including 64 women aged 45-70  years, who had not had their last menstruation for at least one year. Subjects  were divided into two groups: low aMM (n = 32), and normal aMM (n-32). Femoral  neck BMD and muscle mass were measured by DXA at baseline and after twelve  months. Pairwise and independent t tests were used for data analysis. RESULTS: Baseline weight, BMI and muscle mass (total and appendicular)  significantly differ between groups (p < 0.05). After twelve months, femoral  neck BMD was significantly lower in the group with low aMM, whereas no  significant difference was observed in the group with normal aMM (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: In postmenopausal women, low appendicular muscle mass is associated  negatively with femoral neck BMD in a short period of time.  © 2011 Orsatti et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

White CP(1), Hitchcock CL, Vigna YM, Prior JC.  Author information: (1)McMaster University Medical Centre, 1280 Main Street West, Hamilton, ON,  Canada L8S 4L8.  We report menstrual and mid-cycle patterns of self-reported ""fluid retention"" in  765 menstrual cycles in 62 healthy women. Self-reported ""fluid retention,""  commonly described as bloating, is one element of the clinical assessment and  diagnosis of premenstrual symptoms. These daily diary data were collected as  part of an observational prospective one-year study of bone changes in healthy  women of differing exercise characteristics. Ovulation was documented by  quantitative basal temperature analysis, and serum estradiol and progesterone  levels were available from initial and final cycles. Fluid retention scores (on  a 0-4 scale) peaked on the first day of menstrual flow (mean ± SE : 0.9 ± 0.1),  were lowest during the mid-follicular period, and gradually increased from 0.22  ± 0.05 to 0.50 ± 0.09 over the 11 days surrounding ovulation. Mid-cycle, but not  premenstrual, fluid scores tended to be lower in anovulatory cycles (ANOVA P =  0.065), and scores were higher around menstruation than at midcycle (P <  0.0001). Neither estradiol nor progesterone levels were significantly associated  with fluid retention scores. The peak day of average fluid retention was the  first day of flow. There were no significant differences in women's  self-perceived fluid retention between ovulatory and anovulatory cycles.  DOI: 10.1155/2011/138451 PMCID: PMC3154522 PMID: 21845193"

Niger J Physiol Sci. 2011 Dec 20;26(2):199-206.  Effects of a12-week endurance exercise program on adiposity and flexibility of  Nigerian perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.  Ogwumike OO(1), Arowojolu AO, Sanya AO.  Author information: (1). yemfide@yahoo.com.  Menopause is a sign of aging in the woman. Loss of ovarian function induces a  reduction in resting metabolic rate, physical energy expenditure, fat-free mass  and abdominal adipose tissue accumulation. Location of adipose tissue deposit in  abdominal region plays an important role in occurrence of hyperlipidemia,  diabetes, hypertension and atherosclerosis. Although regular participation in  physical exercise have been suggested to improve adiposity and body flexibility  which are important health related components of physical fitness, few published  studies are available on the effect of exercise on Nigerian menopausal women.  This study investigated effects of a twelve-week endurance exercise program  (EEP) on central and abdominal obesity as well as flexibility of perimenopausal  and postmenopausal Nigerian women. The study employed a pretest- posttest  control group design comprising a sample of 175 apparently healthy, literate,  sedentary women within age range 40-59 years. They were workers in state and  federal establishments in Ibadan North Local Government Area of Oyo State,  Nigeria. Based on history of their last menstrual period, women with regular or  irregular menstrual cycle status were allocated into perimenopausal group and  those who no longer menstruated into postmenopausal group. A table of random  numbers was used for further allocation into perimenopausal exercise group  (PEMEG, 45), postmenopausal exercise group (POMEG, 45) perimenopausal control  group (PEMCG, 42) and postmenopausal control group (POMCG, 43). Waist Hip Ratio  (WHR), Body Mass Index (BMI) as well as Hip and Trunk Flexibility (HTF) were  evaluated at baseline and 4weekly intervals until end of 12th week. EEP  consisted of a 10-station circuit of cardiovascular endurance, flexibility,  coordination, abdominal and pelvic floor muscle exercises. Data were analyzed  using descriptive and inferential statistics. Mean age of participants was  52.3±4.1 years, 95% C.I (51.64-52.88) years. Significant reduction occurred  between baseline and end of 12th week mean values of WHR in PEMEG (0.86 ± 0.08  vs 0.71 ± 0.07)and POMEG groups (0.88± 0.06 vs0.77 ± 0.07) while significant  increases were observed between baseline values and end of 12th week mean values  of HTF in PEMEG (18.84 ± 4.23vs28.27± 3.82) and POMEG (19.51 ± 4.02vs25.97±  2.36) (p<0.05). Significant changes did not occur in BMI in both groups even  though mean differences were observed in baseline values compared with end of  12th week mean values of these variables. In PEMCG and POMCG groups, there were  no observable changes in mean values of WHR, BMI and HTF from baseline to end of  study. Participation in endurance exercise program is essential for  perimenopausal and postmenopausal Nigerian women for improved central and  abdominal adiposity as well as flexibility.

Hum Reprod. 2010 Sep;25(9):2328-39. doi: 10.1093/humrep/deq172. Epub 2010 Jul 6.  Estrogen and progesterone exposure is reduced in response to energy deficiency  in women aged 25-40 years.  Williams NI(1), Reed JL, Leidy HJ, Legro RS, De Souza MJ.  Author information: (1)Department of Kinesiology, Women's Health and Exercise Laboratories, Penn  State University, Noll Laboratory, University Park, PA 16802, USA. niw1@psu.edu  BACKGROUND: Alterations in circulating steroids are believed to be important  mediators of the impact that diet and exercise have on breast cancer risk and  changes in bone density. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that moderate  exercise training combined with caloric restriction would produce significant  menstrual disturbances and alterations in ovarian steroids in premenopausal  women. METHODS: Sedentary premenopausal women (25-40 years; body mass index: 23.6 +/-  0.6 kg/m(2)) assigned to either a light conditioning (LC, n = 9) or an exercise  combined with caloric restriction group (EX + CR, n = 24) were studied for one  screening, one baseline and four intervention periods equivalent to the length  of subjects' menstrual cycles. Exercise consisted of supervised training  sessions, i.e. two LC or four EX + CR times per week, 30-60 min at a moderate  intensity. The EX + CR group was prescribed a diet representing a caloric  restriction of 20-35% below baseline energy requirements, whereas the LC group  remained eucaloric. Ovarian steroid exposure was determined with daily urinary  estrone-1- and pregnanediol glucuronides (E1G and PdG, respectively) and  mid-cycle urinary LH measures. Fitness, body composition, and serum sex hormone  binding globulin (SHBG) and serum estradiol (E2) were assessed repeatedly. RESULTS: The intervention produced significant increases in VO(2) max and  decreases in both body weight (-3.7 +/- 0.5 kg; ranged from -8.8 to +1.8 kg) and  percent body fat (-4.5 +/- 0.7%; ranged from -12 to +0.3%), which were  attributable primarily to changes in the EX + CR subjects (time x group; P <  0.05). Serum E2 and urinary E1G and PdG concentrations declined significantly  across the intervention period (time; P < 0.05), whereas SHBG increased  transiently (time; P < 0.05) in the EX + CR subjects, with no significant  changes observed in the LC group. The decrease in E1G area under the curve was  significantly related to the daily energy deficit (R =0.61; P = 0.003), not the  amount of weight lost. There was no significant impact of the intervention on  menstrual cyclicity or the incidence of menstrual disturbances in either group. CONCLUSIONS: A moderate aerobic exercise training program combined with modest  weight loss in accordance with recommended guidelines produces significant  reductions in ovarian steroid exposure without disrupting menstrual cyclicity in  premenopausal women aged 25-40 years. Exposure to a daily energy deficit is a  stronger predictor of the decline in estrogen exposure than decreases in body  weight.

STUDY OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical, metabolic and adverse effects of  pioglitazone over a period of 6 months in obese adolescent and young adults with  polycystic ovary syndrome. DESIGN: This was an open labeled study. Each patient served as her own control. SETTING: Outpatient department of a university affiliated teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Unmarried women (age 15-25 yrs) with chronic anovulatory cycles  and obesity, and with clinical evidence of hyperandrogenism. INTERVENTIONS: Pioglitazone at a dose of 30 mg once daily for a period of 6  months along with dietary advice and exercise. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Resumption of normal menstrual cycles, clinical  improvement in hyperandrogenism and changes in insulin resistance measured by  fasting glucose insulin ratios. RESULTS: Twenty-two women were enrolled. At the end of the study period 91% of  the subjects had regularization of menstrual cycles. There was no change in the  modified Ferriman-Gallwey hirsutism scores. Decline in fasting insulin levels at  the end of the study was 45.6% from baseline along with significant increase in  the fasting glucose/insulin ratio from baseline. CONCLUSION: Administration of pioglitazone for 6 months along with advice about  diet and physical activity in obese adolescents and young adult women with  polycystic ovary syndrome results in significant improvements in menstrual  frequency. There is a significant improvement in insulin resistance using the  G/I ratio (<7.5 mg/10(-4) U) as the biochemical marker.  DOI: 10.1016/j.jpag.2008.08.005 PMID: 19345914 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Author information: (1)Department of Exercise Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario,  Canada.  BACKGROUND: The benefits of exercise are widely recognized, however physically  active women can develop exercise associated menstrual cycle disturbances such  as amenorrhea (i.e., estrogen deficiency) secondary to a chronic energy  deficiency. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of exercise status and estrogen deficiency on  osteoprotegerin (OPG) and its relationship to bone resorption in premenopausal  exercising women. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of serum OPG, urinary c-telopeptides (uCTX),  urinary estrone 3-glucuronide (E1G), urinary pregnanediol 3-glucuronide (PdG)  and bone mineral density (BMD) measured on multiple occasions in 67 women.  Volunteers were retrospectively grouped: 1) sedentary menstruating group (SedMen  n=8), 2) exercising menstruating group (ExMen, n=36), and 3) exercising  amenorrheic group (ExAmen, n=23). One-way ANOVAs were performed, and LSD  post-hoc tests were performed when differences were detected. RESULTS: Subjects were similar with respect to age (24.2+/-1.0 years), weight  (57.8+/-1.7 kg), and height (164.3+/-1.3 cm) (p>0.05). ExMen and ExAmen groups  were more aerobically fit (p=0.003) and had less body fat (p=0.002) than the  SedMen group. Resting energy expenditure/fat free mass was lowest (p=0.001) in  the ExAmen groups. Mean E1G across the measurement period (p<0.001) and overall  E1G exposure as assessed by E1G area under the curve (AUC) (p<0.001) were lower  in the ExAmen group vs. the SedMen and ExMen groups. U-CTX-I was elevated  (p=0.033) in the ExAmen group (281.8+/-40.3 microg/L/mmCr), compared with the  SedMen and ExMen groups (184.5+/-22.4, 197.2+/-14.7 microg/L/mmCr,  respectively). OPG was suppressed (p=0.005) in the ExAmen group (4.6+/-0.2  pmol/L) vs. ExMen group (5.2+/-0.2 pmol/L), and OPG was lower in the SedMen  group (4.1+/-0.3 pmol/L) compared with the ExMen group. Findings were translated  to BMD; the ExAmen group had suppressed total body BMD (p=0.014) and L2-L4 BMD  (p=0.015) vs. the ExMen group. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that OPG responds to the bone loading effect of  exercise, and that suppressed OPG may play a role in the etiology of increased  bone resorption observed in exercising women with chronic estrogen deficiency  secondary to hypothalamic amenorrhea.

Rao SS(1), Singh M, Parkar M, Sugumaran R.  Author information: (1)University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390-9067,  USA. shobha.rao@utsouthwestern.edu  Menopause is the permanent cessation of menstruation resulting from the loss of  ovarian and follicular activity. It usually occurs when women reach their early  50s. Vasomotor symptoms and vaginal dryness are frequently reported during  menopause. Estrogen is the most effective treatment for management of hot  flashes and night sweats. Local estrogen is preferred for vulvovaginal symptoms  because of its excellent therapeutic response. Bone mineral density screening  should be performed in all women older than 65 years, and should begin sooner in  women with additional risk factors for osteoporotic fractures. Adequate intake  of calcium and vitamin D should be encouraged for all postmenopausal women to  reduce bone loss. Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death in  women. Postmenopausal women should be counseled regarding lifestyle  modification, including smoking cessation and regular physical activity. All  women should receive periodic measurement of blood pressure and lipids.  Appropriate pharmacotherapy should be initiated when indicated. Women should  receive breast cancer screening every one to two years beginning at age 40, as  well as colorectal cancer screening beginning at age 50. Women younger than 65  years who are sexually active and have a cervix should receive routine cervical  cancer screening with Papanicolaou smear. Recommended immunizations for  menopausal women include an annual influenza vaccine, a tetanus and diphtheria  toxoid booster every 10 years, and a one-time pneumococcal vaccine after age 65  years.

Exercise and primary dysmenorrhoea : a comprehensive and critical review of the  literature.  Daley AJ(1).  Author information: (1)The Department of Primary Care and General Practice, The Medical School,  University of Birmingham Clinical Sciences Building, Birmingham, UK.  a.daley@bham.ac.uk  Primary dysmenorrhoea (PD) is chronic, cyclic, pelvic, spasmodic pain associated  with menstruation in the absence of identifiable pathology and is typically  known as menstrual cramps or period pain. PD is the most common gynaecological  disorder in menstruating women. Despite treatments being available for PD,  relatively few women consult a clinician about their symptoms, preferring not to  use treatment, or to self-treat using non-pharmacological or over-the-counter  interventions. The notion that exercise is effective in preventing and treating  symptoms has prevailed for many years and led to the promotion of anecdotal  belief that exercise is beneficial. Behavioural interventions such as exercise  may not only reduce dysmenorrhoea, but also eliminate or reduce the need for  medication to control menstrual cramps and other associated symptoms. With  emphasis on data from experimental studies, this report seeks to review the  available evidence regarding the role of exercise in the management of PD and  menstruation-related symptomatology. Using key search terms, online  bibliographical databases were searched from the beginning of each database to 1  April 2007. Despite the widespread belief that exercise can reduce PD, empirical  support is limited. Evidence from observational studies was mixed. Several  observational studies reported that physical activity/exercise was associated  with reduced prevalence of dysmenorrhoea, although numerous other studies found  no significant association between outcomes. Evidence from controlled trials  suggests that exercise can reduce PD and associated symptoms, but these have  been small and of low methodological quality. There are, however, several  plausible mechanisms by which exercise might be effective in the management of  PD. A large randomized controlled trial is required before women and clinicians  are advised that exercise is likely to be effective in reducing PD and related  menstrual symptoms.

Estrogen hormones  (E2) have been shown to protect lymphocytes from apoptosis in vitro, but it is  unknown whether they can attenuate the apoptotic response to maximal exercise.  The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of menstrual cycle variation  on exercise-induced lymphocyte apoptosis in humans following exercise. Untrained  healthy young men and regularly menstruating women not using hormonal  contraceptives volunteered for the study. Women performed a maximal effort  treadmill test for VO2 max once in the follicular phase (FOL) and once in the  mid-luteal phase (ML) of their cycles. Men completed two VO2 max tests with  periods of time between tests matched to those of the female subjects. Blood was  collected before (PRE) and immediately after exercise (POST), and analyzed for  apoptotic lymphocytes and estradiol. E2 concentrations in women were  significantly greater during ML versus during FOL, both PRE and POST (p<0.0001).  The percent of exercise-induced lymphocyte apoptosis was similar between women  (23.2%+/-1.0%) and men (21.5%+/-0.4%). In women, the apoptotic response to  maximal exercise was similar regardless of menstrual cycle phase  (FOL=23.7%+/-0.9%, ML=22.7%+/-1.1%). Although elevated female sex hormones in  vitro may exert anti-apoptotic effects, these data suggest that in vivo  concentrations confer no protection to lymphocytes during exhaustive exercise.

METHODS: 613 runners were randomly sampled during the registration period for an  endurance event. Demographic information, including self-reported height and  weight, training and injury history and menstrual history, was collected by  questionnaire. RESULTS: Ultra-marathon (ULTRA) participants (n = 276) were significantly older  (mean (SD) 39 (8.2) vs 34 (10.5) years; p<0.001), lighter (58.2 (6.6) vs 59.6  (8.3) kg; p<0.05) and reported a higher training volume (p<0.001) than  half-marathon (HALF) participants (n = 337). Significantly more ULTRA subjects  than HALF subjects reported a previous bone stress injury (21% vs 14%; p<0.05).  There was no difference between the groups for menstrual status, but age at  menarche was later (p<0.01) in the ULTRA group. Data were combined according to  the absence (REG; n = 368/602 (61%)) or presence (IRREG; n = 234/602 (39%)) of a  history of menstrual irregularity. Subject morphology was similar between  groups, but the IRREG group had a higher self-reported measure on the  self-loathing subscale (SLSS; p<0.01). The whole group was then classified  according to current menstrual status, with 165 women being classified as  currently irregular. (OLIGO/AMEN; 11.6%) and 445 women as currently regular  (EUMEN; 88.4%). There were no morphological differences between the groups,  however the OLIGO/AMEN group had a later age of menarche (p<0.01) than the EUMEN  group. Further, women who reported a previous bone stress injury had higher SLSS  scores than those who did not (2.91 (0.98) vs 2.68 (0.84); p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: There may be two independent mechanisms associated with energy  balance, which are related to bone stress injuries, but may not necessarily be  related to menstrual dysfunction.

METHODS: We followed 1,283 women aged 15-79 years at baseline selected randomly  from the inhabitants of three areas in Japan for 6 years, and examined 1,130  subjects with no disease or administration of drugs affecting bone metabolism.  The annual change in bone density at the spine, total hip, and distal one third  of the radius was determined during the follow-up period by dual x-ray  absorptiometry and was compared among the groups using different levels of  biochemical markers at baseline, including serum osteocalcin (OC) and  bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (bone ALP), free and total (tDPD) forms of  immunoreactive deoxypyridinoline, and type I collagen crosslinked C-terminal  telopeptide (CTX) in urine. RESULTS: Premenopausal women aged 45 years or older with elevated levels of OC,  bone ALP, CTX, or tDPD showed significantly greater bone loss at most skeletal  sites during the follow-up period than those with lower levels, after adjustment  for the effects of age, height, weight, dietary calcium intake, regular  exercise, and current smoking. The greatest coefficient of determination of the  model was observed in the association between CTX and bone loss at the hip  during the first 3 years of follow-up (42.8%). These subjects were pooled with  perimenopausal women at baseline, and those who still menstruated at follow-up  in this pooled group showed significant but more modest associations, whereas  those who entered menopause during the follow-up period showed clear  associations. However, early postmenopausal women with less than 5 or 10 years  since menopause showed an association that was limited mostly to the distal  radius, and other postmenopausal groups had virtually no association. CONCLUSION: Biochemical markers of bone turnover may predict bone loss in women  undergoing menopausal transition but may not predict bone loss in postmenopausal  women.

Stress. 2006 Mar;9(1):41-51. doi: 10.1080/10253890600591678.  Neuroendocrine responses to psychological stress in eumenorrheic and  oligomenorrheic women.  McComb JJ(1), Qian XP, Veldhuis JD, J McGlone J, Norman RL.  Author information: (1)Department of Health Exercise and Sport Sciences, Texas Tech University,  Lubbock, TX 79409-3011, USA. jacalyn.mccomb@ttu.edu  Neuroendocrine adaptive responses to psychological stress include activation of  the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and sometimes suppression of the  hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. In women who experience chronic  stress, these responses are probably responsible for disturbances in the  menstrual cycle. In the present experiment, we investigated the effect of an  acutely stressful situation on the physiological and neuroendocrine responses in  college age women. We hypothesized that females who are experiencing some degree  of abnormal menstrual function or women who have less-robust cycles  (oligomenorrheic females) would exhibit differences in gonadotropin secretion  from eumenorrheic females when exposed to psychological stressors. Fifteen women  completed this study: eumenorrheic (n = 5) and oligomenorrheic women (n = 5) who  experienced a series of psychological stressors, and eumenorrheic controls (n =  5). Blood samples were taken at 10 min intervals for 8 h (09:00-17:00) in each  woman during the mid-follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. The psychological  stressors were administered for 1 h beginning at 13:00 h. Luteinizing hormone  (LH), growth hormone (GH) and cortisol were measured in each sample to assess  the effect of stress on secretion of these hormones. Deconvolution analysis was  used to analyze pulsatile hormone secretion and the approximate entropy (ApEn)  statistic analyzed the regularity of release of each hormone. Although, there  were significant changes in heart rate (HR), skin resistance (SR) and cortisol  levels in the stressed women during the psychological stressor compared to  resting baseline values but not in the controls, there was no difference in  either LH or GH secretion between women who experienced stress and those who did  not. Furthermore, there were no differences in the LH or GH secretion patterns  in the oligomenorrheic and eumenorrheic women exposed to the psychological  stressor.

METHOD: 14 women with congenital factor VII deficiency registered with the  Haemophilia Centre at the Royal Free Hospital were interviewed and their case  notes reviewed. All women completed Pictorial Blood assessment Chart (PBAC) for  assessment of menstrual blood loss and a quality of life questionnaire during  menstruation. Similar questionnaire and PBAC was completed by an age matched  healthy control group of 23 women. RESULTS: Median age of study group was 35 yrs and of control group 34 yrs.  Median FVII level of the study group was 31.5 IU/dL Two women had severe FVII  deficiency (FVII level < 10 IU/dL) and 12 women had mild-moderate FVII  deficiency. 57% women (8/14) from study group had menorrhagia (PBAC score > 100)  compared with 17% (4/23) women from the control group. Six women (43%) from the  study group were diagnosed with anaemia due to heavy periods, compared to two  (9%) in the control group. The quality of life scores during menstruation were  significantly worse in the women with FVII deficiency, compared to controls. CONCLUSION: Women with factor VII deficiency exhibit a spectrum of bleeding  symptoms, menorrhagia being one of the commonest symptoms. This has adverse  effect on their quality of life.

Abraham SF(1), Pettigrew B, Boyd C, Russell J, Taylor A.  Author information: (1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Sydney, Royal North  Shore Hospital, NSW, Australia. sabraham@med.usyd.edu.au  We investigated the usefulness of amenorrhoea as a criterion in eating disorder  diagnoses. Menstrual history, eating disordered behavior and weight history of  251 female eating disorder inpatients were assessed on admission to hospital.  Menstrual status of 88 (35%) could not be assessed (80 taking hormonal  contraception, 5 (< 16 years) had never menstruated, one hysterectomized, 2  postmenopausal). Of the remaining 163; 90 had secondary amenorrhoea (no periods  for > 3 months), 19 irregular periods and 54 regular cycles. Some patients with  recent changes in energy status, who warranted inpatient treatment for their  eating disorder did not develop amenorrhoea until later during their admission.  Menstrual disturbance is not limited to anorexia nervosa, 24% of patients with  an eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS) and 15% of bulimic patients  had amenorrhoea/oligomenorrhoea on admission. The best predictors (82% cases,  83% noncases, R2 = 0.41) of secondary amenorrhoea at admission, were; current  BMI < or = 18, and having rules for exercising. Menstrual status of women with  an eating disorder diagnosis cannot always be assessed, is mostly measuring low  body weight and exercise and is not useful in planning or initiating treatment.  There is insufficient evidence to support the use of amenorrhoea as a criterion  for any eating disorder.  DOI: 10.1080/01674820500064997 PMID: 16295519 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Gunes M(1), Kayikcioglu F, Ozturkoglu E, Haberal A.  Author information: (1)Department of Gynecology, SSK Ankara Maternity and Women's Health Teaching  Hospital, Ankara, Turkey.  AIM: To report 11 cases of incisional endometriosis after cesarean section,  episiotomy and other gynecologic procedures. The diagnostic approaches and  therapies for incisional endometriosis are also evaluated. METHODS: Eleven patients who presented with a painful nodule that was increasing  in size during menstruation on the scar of a previous gynecologic procedure were  examined retrospectively. RESULTS: All patients presented with a palpable painful lesion, located on the  cesarean section incision, perineal episiotomy incision or the vaginal cuff  after hysterectomy. All masses were increasing during menstruation and all  patients had been having cyclical pain that worsened during menstrual periods.  The mean age of the patients was 28.2 years. The onset of symptoms was referred  at variable intervals after surgery ranging between 2 and 11 years (mean: 5.72  years). Ultrasound examination confirmed hypoechoic mass septated with cystic  and solid components in the abdomen without intra-abdominal communications. All  endometriotic masses were completely excised under general anesthesia. The  excised masses were sent for microscopic examination which confirmed the  diagnosis of endometriosis. CONCLUSION: Incisional endometriosis seems to be common in women who have had a  cesarean section, although it does occur after other procedures and de novo. It  is suggested that caution is exercised during gynecologic procedures to avoid  transplantation of endometrium to the anterior abdominal wall. The preferred  management is to excise the lesion completely even if this necessitates fascial  excision.  DOI: 10.1111/j.1447-0756.2005.00322.x PMID: 16176520 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Descriptive study aimed at identifying the aspects that women, cared for at a  Service of Gynecology and Obstetrics, consider positive and negative in  exercising their sexuality in the climacteric phase. Data was collected through  individual interviews, using the technique of critical incidents. The 45 women  that were interviewed mentioned 86 situations, of which 41 (47.7 percent) were  considered positive and 45 (52.3 percent) negative. The situations were  classified in three categories: relationship with a partner, intercourse and the  woman as a social being. The results showed that these women gave priority to  the quality of the relationship and to the demonstration of emotion in a  romantic context. They highlighted their dissatisfaction with their self-image  and with the existence of sexual dominance of the men over women. The study made  possible a wider understanding regarding the climacteric period, thus offering  subsidies for an assistance to women's health that contemplates the sexual  dimension.

Author information: (1)Office for Gender and Health, Department of Psychiatry, The University of  Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. janetrg@unimelb.edu.au  OBJECTIVE: To investigate factors associated with the presence, severity, and  frequency of hot flushes. DESIGN: A 9-year prospective study of 438 Australian-born women, aged 45 to 55  years and menstruating at baseline. Annual fasting blood collection, physical  measurements, and interviews including questions about bothersome hot flushes in  previous 2 weeks were performed. A ""hot flush index"" score was calculated from  the product of the severity and frequency data. Data were analyzed using  random-effects time-series regression models. RESULTS: A total of 381 women supplied complete data over the follow-up years. A  total of 350 women experienced the menopause transition, of whom 60 (17%) never  reported bothersome hot flushes. At baseline, women who reported hot flushes  were significantly more likely to have higher negative moods, not be in full- or  part-time paid work, smoke, and not report exercising every day. Over the 9-year  period of the study, variables significantly associated with reporting  bothersome hot flushes were relatively young age (P < 0.001), low exercise  levels (P < 0.05), low estradiol levels (P < 0.001), high follicle-stimulating  hormone (FSH) levels (P < 0.001), smoking (P < 0.01), being in the late  menopause transition (P < 0.001), or being postmenopausal (P < 0.001). In women  reporting hot flushes, the hot flush index score increased as their FSH levels  increased (P < 0.01), as they entered the late stage of the menopause transition  (P < 0.001), and as they became postmenopausal (P < 0.05), and decreased with as  their age (P < 0.001) and exercise level (P < 0.05) increased. Between-women  analyses found that the hot flush index score was greater in women with higher  average FSH levels over time (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Menopause status, FSH and estradiol levels, age, exercise level, and  smoking status all contributed to the experience of bothersome hot flushes.

A prospective study of changes in bone turnover and bone density associated with  regaining weight in women with anorexia nervosa.  Bolton JG(1), Patel S, Lacey JH, White S.  Author information: (1)Liaison Psychiatry Service, St Helier Hospital, Wrythe Lane, Carshalton  Surrey, SM5 1AA, UK. jgbolton@sghms.ac.uk  Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a condition of self-induced weight loss, associated  with an intense fear of gaining weight. Previous studies have shown that bone  density may increase with regaining and maintaining normal weight; however,  relatively little is known about the changes in bone metabolism that occur  during weight restoration. We describe the effect of weight restoration and  maintenance of weight over 1 year on bone mineral density (BMD) and bone  turnover. We recruited women from the eating disorders services at the South  West London and St George's Mental Health NHS Trust, and the Priory and Charter  Nightingale Hospitals in London, UK. Details of their AN, fracture history,  menstrual history and exercise were obtained by interview and case note review.  Morning samples of blood and second void urine were taken for biochemical  analysis. BMD was measured by DXA at the lumbar spine (LS), femoral neck (FN),  distal radius (RD) and total body bone mineral content (BMC). Patients then  entered the treatment program, which includes re-feeding, dietary education and  psychotherapy. Over a period of 42 months, we recruited 55 women who agreed to  participate in this study and underwent baseline investigations. Of these, 15  (27%) subjects achieved and then maintained their target weight for the duration  of the study. At baseline for all subjects (n=55) estradiol levels were lower  than the normal reference ranges (both follicular and luteal phases) in 91% of  the women. Bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP) concentrations were lower  than the premenopausal reference range in 55% of women, and urinary  deoxypyridinoline (DPD) was above the premenopausal reference range in 78% of  women. Baseline lumbar spine BMD was positively related to BMI (Pearson's  r=0.29, P=0.04) and inversely related to bone turnover markers: urinary DPD  (Pearson's r=-0.39, P=0.01 and serum BSAP (Pearson's r=-0.3, P=0.06). The 15  patients who regained and maintained weight were followed-up for a mean duration  of 69 weeks (SD 7.3, range 54 to 84 weeks). Mean BMI increased from 14.2 (1.7)  to 20.2 (0.77) kg/m2 and remained stable throughout follow-up. Menstruation  resumed in 8 of the 15 women. Total body BMC and LS BMD increased significantly  over the duration of follow-up (by 4.3% each), but FN BMD and distal radius  remained stable. Lumbar spine bone area also increased significantly, whereas FN  and distal radius did not. These changes were associated with a significant  increase in BSAP (P=0.01), and a non-significant trend for a decrease in DPD  (P=0.10). Our findings suggest that when women are at low body weight they are  in a hypo-estrogenic state, which is associated with imbalance of bone turnover  (high bone resorption and low bone formation). This is reversed with weight gain  and persists as target weight is maintained and is associated with increases in  BMC and BMD.  DOI: 10.1007/s00198-005-1972-7 PMID: 16027954 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Author information: (1)Division of Endocrinology, Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02115,  USA. diane.stafford@childrens.harvard.edu  Young women have become increasingly active in athletics during the 20th  century. Those involved in sports that emphasize lean body type are at high risk  for the development of menstrual dysfunction, including amenorrhea. This is  mediated by an alteration in function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian  (HPO) axis, with loss of normal secretion of luteinizing hormone, and subsequent  lack of estrogen production. Disruption of the HPO axis appears to be dependent  on the body's recognition of an energy imbalance, which may be due to a lack of  compensatory caloric intake in the face of significant energy expenditure. Other  pituitary hormones, such as triiodothyronine, growth hormone, and insulin-like  growth factor-1 may also be affected. These metabolic changes have an impact on  bone mineralization during a critical period in the development of bone mass.  Recognition by physicians of the so-called 'female athlete triad', consisting of  disordered eating, amenorrhea, and osteoporosis, may allow therapeutic  intervention. Diagnosis of eating disorders and decreased bone mineral density  can have significant impact on the health of the young athlete. Treatment is  aimed at restoring normal menstrual function by increasing caloric intake to  balance the increased energy demands of athletic participation. Concurrent  treatment of the hypoestrogenemic state using estrogen replacement is  controversial, but may aid in alleviating further loss of bone mass.

OBJECTIVE: To study the reproducibility of self-reported age at natural  menopause, reported by women in their 70s, compared with menopause age reported  in the initial postmenopausal period. DESIGN: A prospective study conducted in Göteborg, Sweden, based on a random  sample of the total female population, started in 1968-1969, with follow ups in  1974-1975, 1980-1981, and 1992-1993. A total of 1,009 women born in 1922, 1918,  or 1914 (participation rate 90.3%), representative of women of the respective  ages in the general population, participated in the initial examination in  1968-1969. Of those women reporting natural menopause some time between 1968 and  1981, 565 women recalled their menopause age in 1992. RESULTS: The mean interval between the first and second reports was 18.3 years.  The mean difference between first-reported and recalled menopause was 0.05  years. When menopause age was recalled in 1992-1993, 55.6% of the women with a  natural menopause recalled their age at menopause correctly within 1 year, 22.6%  underestimated their menopause age by more than 1 year, and 21.8% overestimated  their menopause age by more than 1 year. Women undergoing early menopause (<45  years) tended to overestimate menopause age, whereas women undergoing late  menopause (>55 years) tended to underestimate menopause age. These differences  could not be explained by age, interval since menopause, smoking, exercise,  education, or socioeconomic status. CONCLUSIONS: Menopause ages reported at an interval of almost 20 years showed a  significant correlation. However, a regression tendency of the values toward the  mean was observed, suggesting that strong correlation at the group level does  not imply precision at the extremes.

OBJECTIVES: Feasibility study of SHT on Romanian PMW (from Bucharest) was based  on English working protocol of the coordinator and on the good practice rules.  We proposed to include in trial 100-150 PMW. We have solicited 456 women for  study participation, age between 45-64 years, which have lesser than 1 year  after the stop of menstruation and accepted all conditions to include in study  (absence of mammary, uterine, or other cancers, deep venous phlebitis). All  conditions were accepted by 121 women. Mean age was 55 +/- 5 years. METHODS: All PMW was randomized in many groups of study. It was administrated  either active SHT (estrogens as Progynova, or estrogens and cyproteronate as  Climen, both from Schering) or Placebo (Pl) in women grouped: 1.  nonhysterectomized (93) randomized for Climen (42) or Pl (42), and  hysterectomized (28) randomized for Climen (9), Progynova (9), Pl (10). The  effectuated investigations were: clinical history; laboratory data for blood  lipids, coagulation, inflammation, cytovaginal control; mammography;  osteodensitometry DEXA. Cardiology investigations were: ECG, exercise ECG,  echocardiography and Holter registrations in selected case. Control examinations  were made at 3 months mean period, excepting mammography and DEXA. RESULTS: After 3 months 46 PMW (38%) retired from the study for: altered first  mammography 18 (15%), for side drug reactions (only for Progynova) 8 (7%), for  other reasons 20 (17%). CONCLUSIONS: This feasibility study shows that, in Romania, a clinical trial on  cardiovascular and general effects of SHT in PMW is possible. But, for  realization of the proposed aim of the study to follow up a minimum 600 women in  10 years, we estimate the need of recruitment of 2500-3000 women, which must  conform to the protocol conditions.

Age of menarche: the role of some psychosocial factors.  Romans SE(1), Martin JM, Gendall K, Herbison GP.  Author information: (1)Centre for Research in Women's Health, University of Toronto, Toronto,  Ontario, Canada.  BACKGROUND: The goal of this study was to determine associations between the age  of first menstrual period (menarche) and adverse childhood experiences in a  random community sample of New Zealand women. Previous reports have linked early  menarche to absence of a live-in father figure and to family conflict, as well  as genetic determination of early puberty and adiposity. METHOD: Two groups of women randomly selected from the community on their  responses to a mailed screening questionnaire on childhood sexual abuse (CSA)  were interviewed in detail. Data about their childhood experiences, including  age of menarche, were collected on two occasions, 6 years apart. Early menarche  was defined as first menstruation occurring before the age of 12 years. RESULTS: Univariate analyses identified a number of adverse childhood  experiences preceded early menarche, which was reported by 20.3% of this sample.  These included low family socio-economic status, absence of father, a number of  variables showing family conflict, poor relationships between the girl and  either/both parents, a self-rated childhood personality style as a loner,  childhood physical and sexual abuse. Sequential modelling showed parental rows,  being a loner and the duration of CSA to be most important, although lack of a  father and any CSA were each also independently associated with early menarche.  No variables survived the modelling exercise as predictors of early menarche for  those women who did not report childhood sexual abuse. CONCLUSIONS: The identified variables statistically interacted with each other  in a highly complex manner. The attempt to rank their importance was only  partially successful, for methodological reasons (half the sample reporting  CSA). Chronic or protracted CSA needs to be added to the list of factors  associated with early menarche in future studies.  DOI: 10.1017/s0033291703007530 PMID: 12877408 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"
12519869,Luteinizing hormone pulsatility is disrupted at a threshold of energy availability in regularly menstruating women.,"Loucks AB, Thuma JR","1. J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2003 Jan;88(1):297-311. doi: 10.1210/jc.2002-020369.  Luteinizing hormone pulsatility is disrupted at a threshold of energy  availability in regularly menstruating women.  Loucks AB(1), Thuma JR.  Author information: (1)Department of Biological Sciences, Ohio University, Athens, Ohio 45701, USA.  loucks@ohiou.edu  To investigate the dependence of LH pulsatility on energy availability (dietary  energy intake minus exercise energy expenditure), we measured LH pulsatility  after manipulating the energy availability of 29 regularly menstruating,  habitually sedentary, young women of normal body composition for 5 d in the  early follicular phase. Subjects expended 15 kcal/kg of lean body mass (LBM) per  day in supervised exercise at 70% of aerobic capacity while consuming a clinical  dietary product to set energy availability at 45 and either 10, 20, or 30  kcal/kg LBM.d in two randomized trials separated by at least 2 months. Blood was  sampled daily during treatments and at 10-min intervals for the next 24 h.  Samples were assayed for LH, FSH, estradiol (E2), glucose, beta-hydroxybutyrate,  insulin, cortisol, GH, IGF-I, IGF-I binding protein (IGFBP)-1, IGFBP-3, leptin,  and T3. LH pulsatility was unaffected by an energy availability of 30 kcal/kg  LBM.d (P > 0.3), but below this threshold LH pulse frequency decreased, whereas  LH pulse amplitude increased (all P < 0.04). This disruption was more extreme in  women with short luteal phases (P < 0.01). These incremental effects most  closely resembled the effects of energy availability on plasma glucose,  beta-hydroxybutyrate, GH, and cortisol and contrasted with the dependencies  displayed by the other metabolic hormones (simultaneously P < 0.05). These  results demonstrate that LH pulsatility is disrupted only below a threshold of  energy availability deep into negative energy balance and suggest priorities for  future investigations into the mechanism that mediates the nonlinear dependence  of LH pulsatility on energy availability.

Soy isoflavones: no effects on bone mineral content and bone mineral density in  healthy, menstruating young adult women after one year.  Anderson JJ(1), Chen X, Boass A, Symons M, Kohlmeier M, Renner JB, Garner SC.  Author information: (1)Department of Nutrition, Schools of Public Health and Medicine, University of  North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599, USA. jjb_anderson.umc.edu  BACKGROUND: The effects of isoflavone-enriched soy protein on human bone mineral  content (mass) and density in healthy, menstruating young adult females have not  been examined in a comparative prospective investigation. Peri- and  post-menopausal women have been reported to show beneficial effects of  isoflavones on bone measurements. Therefore, young women may also be able to  improve their accrual of peak bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral  density (BMD) during the early adult years of bone consolidation with an  isoflavone-enriched diet. OBJECTIVES: In this controlled, double-blind intervention, we tested the  hypothesis that an isoflavone-rich soy protein diet increases BMC and BMD in  young adult females over a period of one year in comparison to a control group  receiving soy protein that has isoflavones removed. DESIGN: Young healthy women of any ethnic background, 21 to 25 years of age,  were divided into two groups, placebo (n = 13) and supplement (n = 15). The soy  protein supplement was enriched with isoflavones ( approximately 90 mg of total  isoflavones/day), whereas the control protein diet was isoflavone-deficient,  even though it contained the same amount of soy protein and other ingredients as  the isoflavone-rich diet. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometric (DXA) measurements  of BMC and BMD were made at baseline and at 6 and 12 months. DXA estimates of  body composition, including fat mass and lean body mass, were generated from  whole-body BMC measurements. BMI was calculated as weight (kg) over height (m)  squared. Physical activity was assessed, and three-day dietary records were  taken at entry (baseline) and at 6 and 12 months. RESULTS: No changes in BMD after 12 months were found in either the  isoflavone-treated (treatment) group or the isoflavone-deficient (control)  group. Other variables also remained essentially constant over the 12-month  period, including normal menstrual patterns in both the treatment and control  groups. CONCLUSIONS: The isoflavone-rich soy preparation had no effects on BMC and BMD  over a 12-month period in young healthy adult females with normal menses. An  isoflavone-rich supplement appears to have little or no effect on bone in young  adult women with normal ovarian function, at least over this 12-month study  period.

The epidemiology of endometriosis.  Cramer DW(1), Missmer SA.  Author information: (1)Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Biology, Brigham and  Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.  dcramer@partners.org  Advances in understanding the epidemiology of endometriosis have lagged behind  other diseases because of methodologic problems related to disease definition  and control selection. Nevertheless, a better picture of the epidemiology of  endometriosis has emerged over the past few decades. Prevalence estimates of the  disease in clinic populations vary from about a 4% occurrence of largely  asymptomatic endometriosis found in women undergoing tubal ligation to 50% of  teenagers with intractable dysmenorrhea. General population incidence during the  1970s in this country has been suggested to be 1.6 per 1000 white females aged  15-49, while a more current study based upon hospital discharges finds  endometriosis as a first listed diagnosis in 1.3 per 1000 discharges in women  aged 15-44. There is a clinical impression that blacks have lower rates of  endometriosis and Orientals have higher rates than whites. A variety of personal  risk factors for endometriosis have also been described. Women with  endometriosis may be taller and thinner. Menstrual factors reported to increase  risk include dysmenorrhea, early menarche, and shorter cycle lengths. There is  support for the idea that lifestyle exposures that might raise or lower estrogen  levels could affect risk, including a decreased risk associated with smoking and  exercise and an increased risk associated with caffeine or alcohol use. These  risk factors appear to be compatible with the central importance of retrograde  menstruation influenced by outflow obstruction that might affect its amount,  immune factors that might affect its ability to be cleared, or hormonal stimuli  that might affect its growth. In this model, dysmenorrhea could be either a  disease symptom or a manifestation of outflow obstruction. Nulliparity could be  either a consequence of disease or a cause since nulliparous women would not  have the benefit of cervical dilation associated with labor and delivery. Since  there is evidence that family history is a risk factor for disease, a challenge  is how to integrate genetic factors into the model. The genetics of  endometriosis might be advanced if we could identify an ""endometriosis  phenotype"". We propose that this may consist of early menarche, short cycles,  painful periods, subfertility, and possibly tall stature that could be explained  by genetic factors that predispose to poor endowment of germ cells and  canalization defects of the cervix. The value of establishing an ""endometriosis  phenotype"" is that, as candidates for genetic markers are identified, particular  genotypes can be correlated with these factors even if a formal diagnosis of  endometriosis has not been made. Additional well-designed case-control and  cohort studies will be necessary to test theories related to pathogenesis,  establish the precise relationship between reproductive morbidity and  endometriosis, identify specific genetic factors, and establish long-term risks.

Author information: (1)Laboratoire de Physiologie et Biomécanique de l'Exercice Musculaire UFR-APS,  Université de Rennes II, France. nathalieboisseau@hotmail.com  BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess gluco-se tolerance during  exercise in women on oral contraceptives. METHODS: To this end, we investigated the effects of glucose ingestion on  glucose and hormonal responses in 7 women on oral contraceptives (OC(+);  21.3+/-1.3 yrs) and 7 normally menstruating (OC(-); 22.6+/-1.3 yrs) during an  ergocycle test (30 min, 60% VO2max). Venous blood samples were withdrawn at 0,  3, 5, 10, 15 and 30 min exercise and at the 30th min postexercise. Glucose was  ingested per os (0.5 g x kg(-1) b.w) between the 2nd and the 3rd min of the  exercise. RESULTS: Under resting condition, plasma glucose and catecholamine  concentrations were similar in both groups whereas plasma GH and insulin levels  were greater in OC(+) (p<0.05). Glucose/insulin ratio (G/I), used as an  indicator of insulin resistance, suggested a reduced insulin sensitivity at rest  in the OC(+) (p<0.05). No significant differences were observed between OC(+)  and OC(-) in plasma glucose, insulin, and catecholamine concentrations during  exercise. Plasma GH values were greater in OC(+) from the 15th min of the  exercise and during the recovery period (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that oral glucose ingestion at the onset of  prolonged submaximal exercise induced similar glucose tolerance in women taking  or not oral contraceptives.

Effects of lifetime volleyball exercise on bone mineral densities in lumbar  spine, calcaneus and tibia for pre-, peri- and postmenopausal women.  Ito M(1), Nakamura T, Ikeda S, Tahara Y, Hashmi R, Tsurusaki K, Uetani M,  Hayashi K.  Author information: (1)Department of Radiology, Nagasaki University School of Medicine, Japan.  To clarify the effects of habitual volleyball exercise on bone in women during  the menopausal periods, we measured bone mineral densities (BMDs) of the lumbar  spine, calcaneus and tibia every 12 months for 2 years and estimated factors  related to the baseline values and annual loss rates. Forty Japanese female  volleyball players 42-62 years of age, who had belonged to the district  non-professional club for more than 10 years on average, were recruited. Twenty  women had regular menstruation at the start, but 7 underwent menopause during  the study. Fifty-nine healthy women who did not participate in habitual  exercise, but were otherwise comparable with the players, were recruited as the  controls. The lumbar and calcaneus BMDs were measured by dual-energy X-ray  absorptiometry (DXA), and both the volumetric BMDs and cross-sectional geometry  at the diaphysis of the tibia were measured by peripheral quantitative computed  tomography. The baseline BMDs of all measured sites and the values of the  cortical area and moment of inertia of the tibia in the players were  significantly higher than the values in the control women. In the peri- and  postmenopausal players, the baseline values of the lumbar and calcaneus BMDs  related to total years of participating in regular exercises during adulthood  including volleyball (TYE), body mass index (BMI) and years since menopause  (YSM). Tibia cortical area and moment of inertia values related to TYE. Annual  bone loss rates in the tibia and calcaneus of players were significantly smaller  than those values in the controls. However, the bone loss rates in the lumbar  spine did not differ significantly between the groups. The bone loss rate in the  calcaneus was significantly related to the current number of training hours per  week and YSM. The rate of bone loss in the tibia was related to BMI. These data  indicated that the total number of years participating in exercise activity  during adulthood have positive effects on lumbar and calcaneus BMDs and the  cortical structure of the tibia. Habitual volleyball exercise apparently did not  alleviate the menopause-related bone loss in the lumbar spine.  DOI: 10.1007/s001980170141 PMID: 11303709 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Davis A(1), Godwin A, Lippman J, Olson W, Kafrissen M.  Author information: (1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical  Center, Boston, Massachusetts 02215, USA.  OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of a triphasic combination oral contraceptive  (OC) containing norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol (E2) and placebo in the  treatment of metrorrhagic, menometrorrhagic, oligomenorrheic, and polymenorrheic  dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB). METHODS: In this multicenter, randomized, double-masked study, 201 women (15-50  years of age) with DUB received triphasic norgestimate-ethinyl E2 or placebo,  for three consecutive 28-day treatment cycles. Efficacy was determined by  evaluating investigator and subject assessments of DUB resolution, abnormal  uterine bleeding patterns during an 84-day reference period, and change from  baseline in subjects' quality of life. The sample size was based on the  assumption that the proportions of subjects exhibiting treatment success  (percentage of subjects with investigator and subject overall assessments of DUB  resolution of ""improved"") were 65% for the active group and 40% for the placebo  group (alpha = 0.05, 1 - beta = 0.80). RESULTS: More than 80% of subjects receiving triphasic norgestimate-ethinyl E2  had improvements in their abnormal bleeding patterns as assessed by  investigators, and the subjects themselves compared with fewer than 50% of  subjects in the placebo treatment group (P <.001). Abnormal bleeding patterns  were reported by significantly fewer subjects receiving triphasic  norgestimate-ethinyl E2 than in the placebo treatment group (P <. 001). Change  from baseline in physical functioning (eg, self-care, walking, lifting,  exercising) was significantly more improved in the triphasic  norgestimate-ethinyl E2 group than in the placebo group. CONCLUSION: The triphasic combination of norgestimate and ethinyl E2 is an  effective treatment for metrorrhagic, menometrorrhagic, oligomenorrheic, and  polymenorrheic dysfunctional uterine bleeding.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection is a rare cause of myocardial infarction.  It is a condition with greater prevalence in young women, particularly in the  peripartum or early postpartum period. It also has been described following  intense physical exercise. The pathophysiologic characteristics remain unclear.  Unlike atherosclerotic intimal dissection, the dissection plane lies within the  media or between the media and adventitia. We describe a case of spontaneous  coronary artery dissection in a 44-yr old menstruating woman with mitral valve  prolapse, who experienced acute myocardial infarction after twisting and  throwing a heavy piece of luggage. Coronary angiography showed coronary artery  dissection in a left anterior descending coronary artery at the point of its  emergence from its intramural course. An intimal plaque with 90-95% obstruction  and reduced (TIMI I) flow was demonstrated. The patient was treated with  continued glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor infusion. Angiographic resolution with  return of prompt (TIMI III) flow was noted. Optimal management of spontaneous  coronary artery dissection has not been established and may vary, depending upon  the presence of intimal versus extramural compromise. Coronary artery bypass,  stenting, and thrombolysis have been successful and also have failed, owing to  extension of dissection. Our patient is the first reported patient to have  received tirofiban therapy in the context of spontaneous coronary artery  dissection. Medical therapy has been used most often, and angiographic  resolution has been documented at 94 days, 7 mo, and 1 yr. We document the  earliest case of spontaneous angiographic resolution-within 20 hr.  DOI: 10.1002/1522-726x(200009)51:1<95::aid-ccd22>3.0.co;2-m PMID: 10973029 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Kritz-Silverstein D(1), Wingard DL, Garland FC.  Author information: (1)Department of Family and Preventive Medicine, University of California San  Diego, La Jolla, USA.  The present study examines the association of obesity, cigarette smoking,  alcohol consumption, and exercise with the prevalence of menstrual cycle  disorders among 2912 women aboard U.S. Navy ships. Self-administered surveys  obtained information on weight, height, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption,  and exercise. Participants also indicated whether they experienced cramps or  pain during their period requiring medication or time off work, bleeding between  periods, excessive frequency of periods, heavy periods, periods lasting for  longer than a week, scanty menstrual flow, and irregular periods during the past  90 days. Women ranged in age from 18 to 49 years, with an average of 26 years.  After adjustment for age, race, and pay grade, current cigarette smoking was  associated with increased risk of all menstrual symptoms and cycle disorders. As  compared with nonsmokers, current smokers were at increased risk of cramps or  pain requiring medication or time off work (odds ratio [OR] = 1.13, 95%  confidence interval [CI] = 1.03, 1.25), bleeding between periods (OR = 1.22, CI  = 1.09, 1.38), excessive frequency of periods (OR = 1.33, CI = 1.17, 1.51),  heavy periods (OR = 1.17, CI = 1.06, 1.29), periods lasting longer than a week  (OR = 1.31, CI = 1.16, 1.48), scanty flow (OR = 1.13, CI = 1.01, 1.29), and  irregular periods (OR = 1.14, CI = 1.05, 1.24). Obesity, exercise, and alcohol  consumption did not show consistent associations with menstrual symptoms or  cycle disorders. Logistic regression models that included age, race, pay grade,  and all behavioral and lifestyle variables indicated only cigarette smoking was  associated with an increased risk of bleeding between periods (OR = 1.33, CI =  1.05, 1.68), excessive frequency of periods (OR = 1.38, CI = 1.21, 1.58),  periods lasting longer than a week (OR = 1.45, CI = 1.13, 1.84), and irregular  periods (OR = 1.25, CI = 1.05, 1.47). Although the lifestyle factors are all  potentially modifiable, results suggest that only interventions targeted at  smoking cessation might be useful in reducing the prevalence of menstrual  symptoms, cycle disorders, and time lost from work.

Jankowski C(1), Ben-Ezra V, Kendrick K, Morriss R, Nichols D.  Author information: (1)Department of Kinesiology, Texas Woman's University, Denton 76204, USA.  Postprandial insulin responses (integrated area under the curve) to an oral  glucose load after a period of aerobic exercise and no exercise (control) were  compared in sedentary normoglycemic Mexican American and non-Hispanic women  pair-matched (n = 9) on total body fat mass (21.8 +/- 3.5 kg). The age (27.4 +/-  3.0 years), body mass index (BMI) (23.6 +/- 1.4 kg/m2), waist to hip ratio (WHR)  (0.85 +/- .02), waist circumference (83.5 +/- 4.5 cm), lean mass (36.2 +/- 1.5  kg), and maximal O2 consumption ([VO2 max] 32.9 +/- 1.6 mL x kg(-1) x min(-1))  were similar, although the centrality index (subscapular/triceps skinfolds) was  significantly greater in Mexican Americans (0.88 +/- 0.06 v 0.70 +/- 0.05, P <  .01). Exercise (treadmill walking for 50 minutes at 70% VO2 max) and control  trials were performed 4 weeks apart and 5 to 12 days after the onset of  menstruation. A 75-g oral glucose load was administered 15 hours after the  completion of each trial, with the subjects 12 hours postprandial. Blood samples  were drawn prior to glucose ingestion (fasting, 0 minutes) and at minutes 15,  30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 postingestion. The postprandial insulin response was  calculated using a trapezoidal method. In Mexican Americans, significant (P <  .02) reductions in the postprandial insulin response (exercise v control, 6.5  +/- 1.0 v 8.5 +/- 1.4 pmol/L x min x 10(4)) and fasting insulin (exercise v  control, 77.4 +/- 7.0 v 88.5 +/- 10.3 pmol/L) occurred after exercise compared  with the control condition. In non-Hispanics, neither the postprandial insulin  response (exercise v control, 7.2 +/- 1.0 v 6.2 +/- 0.9 pmol/L x min x 10(4))  nor fasting insulin (exercise v control, 77.0 +/- 8.2 v 82.9 +/- 8.9 pmol/L)  were significantly different between trials. The postprandial insulin response  in the control trial was significantly correlated with the change in the insulin  response (control minus exercise) in the 18 women (r = .56, P = .01). No trial  or group differences were found for postprandial glucose and C-peptide  responses. Mexican American women have a high risk of developing type 2  diabetes, and aerobic exercise may be valuable in the prevention or delay of  onset of diabetes by reducing peripheral insulin resistance.

Age and seasonal distribution of menarche in Korean girls.  Park SH, Shim YK, Kim HS, Eun BL.  PIP: This paper examines the menarchal age of Korean girls and its monthly  distribution to define the possible relationship between menarche and season.  Menarchal age is influenced by diverse factors such as hereditary, geography,  climate, psychological factors, socioeconomic status, body weight and height,  nutritional state, body fat and exercise as well as the presence of chronic  illness. In Korea, there is evidence of secular change toward earlier menarchal  age, where the average menarchal age was 14.8 in 1952, 14.4 years in 1979, 13.4  years in 1986, and 12.5 years in 1988. A cross-sectional study was conducted  from July 1993 to July 1995 among 4237 female middle and high school students,  aged 14-20 years, in Ansan, Korea, to obtain data on demographic  characteristics, menarchal age, month of menarche, and the menarchal age of the  participant's mother. Findings revealed that average menarchal age is 12.5 years  for the girls and 15.4 +or- 2.3 years for their mothers. Menarche is most common  in August and January (summer), January and December (winter) in decreasing  order. Seasonal pattern of menarche may also be related to the psychological  factors during school vacation such as relaxation, decrease stress from studies,  and/or physical rest.

Iron supplementation in athletes. Current recommendations.  Nielsen P(1), Nachtigall D.  Author information: (1)Abteilung Medizinische Biochemie, Universitäts-Krankenhaus Eppendorf,  Hamburg, Germany. nielsen@uke.uni-hamburg.de  There is still debate in the literature on whether or not endurance athletes  tend to have low iron stores. In this article, we propose that endurance  athletes really are at risk of becoming iron deficient due to an imbalance  between absorption of dietary iron and exercise-induced iron loss. The purpose  of this article is to present a critical review of the literature on iron  supplementation in sport. The effect of iron deficiency on performance, its  diagnosis and suggestions for treatment are also discussed. Studies of the  nutritional status of athletes in various disciplines have shown that male, but  not female, athletes clearly achieve the recommended dietary intake of iron (10  to 15 mg/day). This reflects the situation in the general population, with  menstruating women being the main risk group for mild iron deficiency, even in  developed countries. Whereas the benefit of iron supplementation in athletes  with iron deficiency anaemia is well established, this is apparently not true  for non-anaemic athletes who have exhausted iron stores alone (prelatent iron  deficiency); most of the studies in the literature show no significant changes  due to supplementation in the physical capacity of athletes with prelatent iron  deficiency. However, the treatment protocols used in some of these studies do  not meet the general recommendations for the optimal clinical management of iron  deficiency, that is, with respect to adequate daily dosage, mode of  administration and treatment period. For future studies, we recommend a  prolonged treatment period (> or = 3 months) with standardised conditions of  administration (use of a pharmaceutical iron preparation with known high  bioavailability and a dosage of ferrous (Fe++) iron 100 mg/day, taken on an  empty stomach). Currently, decisions regarding iron supplementation are best  made on the basis of taking care of individual athletes. We believe that there  are sufficient arguments to support controlled iron supplementation in all  athletes with low serum ferritin levels. Firstly, the development of iron  deficiency is prevented. Secondly, the nonspecific upregulation of intestinal  metal ion absorption is reverted to normal, thus limiting the hyperabsorption of  potentially toxic lead and cadmium even in individuals with mild iron  deficiency.

9762474,Long-term restoration of deficits in bone mineral density is inadequate in premenopausal women with prior menstrual irregularity.,"Micklesfield LK, Reyneke L, Fataar A, Myburgh KH","1. Clin J Sport Med. 1998 Jul;8(3):155-63. doi: 10.1097/00042752-199807000-00002.  Long-term restoration of deficits in bone mineral density is inadequate in  premenopausal women with prior menstrual irregularity.  Micklesfield LK(1), Reyneke L, Fataar A, Myburgh KH.  Author information: (1)Department of Physiology, University of Cape Town Medical School, South  Africa.  OBJECTIVE: To investigate change in bone mineral density (BMD) in premenopausal  women (age, 29-46 years), some of whom were marathon runners with a history of  menstrual irregularity. DESIGN: Longitudinal follow-up. SETTING: University medical school. PARTICIPANTS: We investigated 8 sedentary controls (SC) and 19 marathon runners  (12 with regular menses (R) and 7 with a history of irregularity (OA) 11.7 +/-  7.9 years before follow-up). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: BMD (g/cm2) of lumbar spine (LS) and proximal femur were  determined at baseline and follow-up (3-5 years later). We calculated a  menstrual history index (MHI) (estimated periods/year since age 13). RESULTS: Body mass, age at menarche, and femoral BMD were not statistically  different. Follow-up LS BMD (g/cm2) was lower (p < 0.01) in OA (0.936 +/- 0.060)  than in R (1.043 +/- 0.103) and SC (1.094 +/- 0.077), even when covarying for  age or both age and mass. No group changed BMD significantly with time. Current  MHI was lower (p < 0.001) in OA (9.7 +/- 1.4) than in R (11.3 +/- 0.5) and SC  (11.8 +/- 0.4). MHI for the teenage years was lower in OA than in SC but not in  R. OA had significantly lower MHI than did R and SC for the third and fourth  decades. Only MHI during the third decade correlated significantly with LS BMD  for all subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Restoration of LS BMD deficit in women with prior menstrual  irregularity aged over 30 is slow and may never reach the same level as  age-related controls; secondly, this may be the result of both bone loss in the  third decade of life and reduced acquisition during adolescence.

9696732,Interactions between the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the female reproductive system: clinical implications.,"Chrousos GP, Torpy DJ, Gold PW","1. Ann Intern Med. 1998 Aug 1;129(3):229-40. doi:  10.7326/0003-4819-129-3-199808010-00012.  Interactions between the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the female  reproductive system: clinical implications.  Chrousos GP, Torpy DJ, Gold PW.  The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis exerts profound, multilevel inhibitory  effects on the female reproductive system. Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)  and CRH-induced proopiomelanocortin peptides inhibit hypothalamic  gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion, whereas glucocorticoids suppress  pituitary luteinizing hormone and ovarian estrogen and progesterone secretion  and render target tissues resistant to estradiol. The  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is thus responsible for the ""hypothalamic""  amenorrhea of stress, which is also seen in melancholic depression,  malnutrition, eating disorders, chronic active alcoholism, chronic excessive  exercise, and the hypogonadism of the Cushing syndrome. Conversely, estrogen  directly stimulates the CRH gene promoter and the central noradrenergic system,  which may explain adult women's slight hypercortisolism; preponderance of  affective, anxiety, and eating disorders; and mood cycles and vulnerability to  autoimmune and inflammatory disease, both of which follow estradiol  fluctuations. Several components of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and  their receptors are present in reproductive tissues as autacoid regulators.  These include ovarian and endometrial CRH, which may participate in the  inflammatory processes of the ovary (ovulation and luteolysis) and endometrium  (blastocyst implantation and menstruation), and placental CRH, which may  participate in the physiology of pregnancy and the timing of labor and delivery.  The hypercortisolism of the latter half of pregnancy can be explained by high  levels of placental CRH in plasma. This hypercortisolism causes a transient  postpartum adrenal suppression that, together with estrogen withdrawal, may  partly explain the depression and autoimmune phenomena of the postpartum period.

Conditions at conception and risk of menstrual disorders.  Smits LJ(1), Willemsen WN, Zielhuis GA, Jongbloet PH.  Author information: (1)Department of Medical Informatics, Epidemiology, and Statistics, University  of Nijmegen, The Netherlands.  In a case-control study, we evaluated the association of the risk of menstrual  disorders with four periconceptional factors: short preceding interpregnancy  interval (< 6 months), low (< or = 19 years) or high (> or = 40 years) maternal  age at conception, and month of conception. We divided 919 women who had visited  a fertility clinic between 1991 and 1995 into three categories: cases (with mean  menstrual cycle length > or = 42 or < or = 21 days, or a variation of > or = 14  days between cycles, or amenorrhea, N = 294), controls (with cycles within a  range of 25-35 days and variation < or = 7 days, N = 520), and intermediates (N  = 105). A self-administrable questionnaire was mailed, asking for information  about maternal reproductive history and age, and potential confounders such as  smoking, exercise, and level of education. Response (77%) differed little among  cases, intermediates, and controls. We found elevated risks for short pregnancy  intervals [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 2.04; 95% confidence interval (CI) =  1.04-4.02] and advanced maternal age (OR = 3.24; 95% CI = 1.27-8.30) but not for  low maternal age (OR = 0.58; 95% CI = 0.11-3.14) (cases vs controls). We found  similar effects for intermediates vs controls. The distribution of month of  conception did not differ much from controls for both cases and intermediates.  The results indicate that conception after short pregnancy intervals or at  advanced maternal age increases the risk of menstrual disorders in daughters.  The precise etiology is unclear, but it may lie in the quality of the oocyte at  conception.  DOI: 10.1097/00001648-199709000-00009 PMID: 9270954 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Epidemiology of endometriosis in a Norwegian county.  Moen MH(1), Schei B.  Author information: (1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University Hospital of Trondheim,  Norway.  OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence and incidence of endometriosis in  Norwegian women aged 40 to 42, and to evaluate reproductive events and  life-style as risk factors for endometriosis as well as to evaluate related  health-problems. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was performed partly as a cross-sectional study  to estimate occurrence of endometriosis, partly as a case-control study to look  for factors associated with endometriosis. The study group consisted of all  female inhabitants--born 1950 to 1952--living in the county of Sør-Trøndelag. In  connection with a cardiovascular screening program information about  reproductive events and gynecological problems including endometriosis and  infertility was obtained. RESULTS: Totally 5139 women were asked to participate, and a questionnaire was  completed by 4034 (78.5%). Endometriosis was reported by 2.0% of the women.  Life-time risk for endometriosis was estimated to 2.2%. The annual incidence of  new cases of endometriosis in this age group is less than 0.3%. There was a  significant association between endometriosis and menarche before age 13, and  frequent menstrual periods. Nulliparity was more common in women with  endometriosis as were infertility problems and pelvic pain. No significant  association was found between endometriosis and exercise, smoking, body mass  index and education. There was a high risk for women with endometriosis having  had cervical conization or gynecological laparotomies such as infertility  surgery, operations on ovaries as well as hysterectomies. CONCLUSION: In Sør-Trøndelag county the prevalence of endometriosis is 2.0% and  the annual incidence is less than 0.3% for women in their early forties. A  woman's life-time risk for endometriosis might be 2.2%. Early menarche, frequent  menstruations, pelvic pain, infertility and nulliparity are associated with  endometriosis.

DESIGN: Cohort analytic study. SETTING: Academic research environment. PARTICIPANTS: Healthy female volunteers: 10 eumenorrheic sedentary, 11  eumenorrheic trained, and 11 amenorrheic trained women. INTERVENTIONS: Blood samples were collected three times per week for either one  complete menstrual cycle (eumenorrheic sedentary and trained subjects) or for a  4-week period (amenorrheic trained subjects). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Plasma beta-endorphin concentrations. RESULTS: beta-Endorphin levels varied considerably across the sampling period  and were not associated with menstrual status, gonadotropin, or gonadal steroid  concentrations. Average beta-endorphin levels were not different between the  follicular and luteal phases for menstruating subjects, but were greater in the  eumenorrheic athletes. Compared with eumenorrheic sedentary subjects, plasma  beta-endorphin levels were higher in the athletic groups, regardless of  menstrual status. CONCLUSION: There were no cycle-related beta-endorphin changes. Eumenorrheic and  amenorrheic athletes have higher beta-endorphin concentrations that may reflect  adaptations to intense training and not exercise-associated amenorrhea.

9041058,High-impact exercise promotes bone gain in well-trained female athletes.,"Taaffe DR, Robinson TL, Snow CM, Marcus R","1. J Bone Miner Res. 1997 Feb;12(2):255-60. doi: 10.1359/jbmr.1997.12.2.255.  High-impact exercise promotes bone gain in well-trained female athletes.  Taaffe DR(1), Robinson TL, Snow CM, Marcus R.  Author information: (1)Musculoskeletal Research Laboratory, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Palo  Alto, California, USA.  Maximizing peak bone mass, as well as reducing its loss after menopause, is  important for the prevention of osteoporosis. One mode of activity, gymnastics  training, invokes high impact loading strains on the skeleton which may have  powerful osteogenic effects. To examine the role of athletic activity,  specifically gymnastics, on bone mineral density (BMD) accretion, we monitored  longitudinal changes in regional and whole body BMD in collegiate women gymnasts  and competitive athletes whose skeletons are exposed to differential loading  patterns: runners and swimmers. Two cohorts were studied. Cohort I = 26 gymnasts  (19.7 +/- 1.2 years), 36 runners (21.1 +/- 2.7 years) and 14 nonathletic women  (19.3 +/- 1.7 years) followed over an 8-month period. Cohort II = 8 gymnasts  (18.9 +/- 1.1 years), 11 swimmers (20.0 +/- 2.3 years) and 11 nonathletic women  (19.0 +/- 1.2 years) followed over a 12-month period. Lumbar spine (L2-4),  femoral neck, and whole body BMD (g/cm2) were assessed by dual-energy X-ray  absorptiometry. For cohort I, the percent change in lumbar spine BMD after 8  months was significantly greater (p = 0.0001) in the gymnasts (2.8 +/- 2.4%)  than in the runners (-0.2 +/- 2.0%) or controls (0.7 +/- 1.3%). An increase in  femoral neck BMD of 1.6 +/- 3.6% in gymnasts was also greater (p < 0.05) than  runners (-1.2 +/- 3.0%) and approached significance compared with controls (-0.9  +/- 2.2%, p = 0.06). For cohort II, gymnasts gained 2.3 +/- 1.6% at the lumbar  spine which differed significantly (p < 0.01) from changes in swimmers (-0.3 +/-  1.5%) and controls (-0.4 +/- 1.7%). Similarly, the change at the femoral neck  was greater (p < 0.001) in gymnasts (5.0 +/- 3.4%) than swimmers (-0.6 +/- 2.8%)  or controls (2.0 +/- 2.3%). The percent change in BMD at any site did not differ  between eumenorrheic and irregularly menstruating athletes. These results  indicate that bone mineral at clinically relevant sites, the lumbar spine and  femoral neck, can respond dramatically to mechanical loading characteristic of  gymnastics training in college-aged women. This occurred despite high initial  BMD values and was independent of reproductive hormone status. The results  provide evidence to support the view that high impact loading, rather than  selection bias, underlies high BMD values characteristic of women gymnasts.  Because all athletes underwent resistance training throughout the year of study,  muscle strengthening activity did not appear to be a significant factor in the  skeletal response observed in gymnasts. We conclude that activities resulting in  high skeletal impacts may be particularly osteotropic for young women.  DOI: 10.1359/jbmr.1997.12.2.255 PMID: 9041058 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Fam Plann Perspect. 1996 Jul-Aug;28(4):174-8.  Early experience with the contraceptive use of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate  in an inner-city clinic population.  Polaneczky M(1), Guarnaccia M, Alon J, Wiley J.  Author information: (1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, New York Hospital-Cornell Medical  College, USA.  There are few data on the experience of American women with the injectable depot  medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) since its recent approval by the Food and  Drug Administration for contraceptive use in the United States. An exploratory  study was conducted using chart reviews and telephone interviews of 261 women  who initiated DMPA use between December 1992 and June 1994 at either a  hospital-based (48%) or community-based (49%) clinic in New York City. Most DMPA  users were single (70%), had had at least one birth (88%), had had at least one  abortion (67%) and had ever practiced contraception (75% of those with available  data). Life-table DMPA continuation rates were 63% at six months and 42% at 12  months and were not affected by the users' age, marital status, pregnancy  history, clinic site or proximity of residence to the clinic. Among adults, the  risk of DMPA discontinuation was highest during the three-month period following  the second injection, while among adolescents, this risk increased throughout  the duration of use. The most commonly reported reasons for method  discontinuation were side effects, primarily menstrual irregularities (30%) and  weight gain (24%).  PIP: An exploratory study of 261 US women who initiated use of depot  medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) between December 1992 and June 1994 at a  hospital- or community-based clinic in New York City highlighted the importance  of side effects to method discontinuation. The mean age of DMPA users was 25  years; 70% were unmarried and 84% were Medicaid recipients. At the time of first  injection, 58% were using no contraceptive method. At telephone interview, the  average time since first injection was 8.6 months. The continuation rate was 81%  at 3 months, 63% at 6 months, 52% at 9 months, and 42% at 12 months. When these  rates were adjusted to assume that the 37 women who were not locatable for  follow-up had discontinued, they became 74%, 53%, 39%, and 30%, respectively.  There was no variation in discontinuation rates on the basis of age, parity,  marital status, insurance status, number of pregnancies or abortions, postpartum  status, or residence. Among the 96 discontinuers for whom data were available,  the most frequently cited reasons were abnormal bleeding (30%), weight gain  (24%), and nausea (12%). The percentage of women with amenorrhea was 34% at 3  months, 43% at 6 months, 66% at 9 months, and 60% at 12 months. Among adults,  the risk of discontinuation was highest in the 3 months after the second  injection; in contrast, the risk of discontinuation among adolescents increased  steadily during the first year of use. Given the strong association between DMPA  side effects and discontinuation, clinic staff are urged to pursue interventions  such as estrogen therapy for amenorrhea and nutrition and exercise counseling  for weight gain.

Heinonen A(1), Sievänen H, Kannus P, Oja P, Vuori I.  Author information: (1)UKK Institute for Health Promotion Research Tampere, Finland.  The aims of this study were to examine the effects of 12 months unilateral  high-resistance strength training and 8-month detraining on bone mineral content  (BMC), density (BMD) and estimated mechanical characteristics of upper limb  bones, and also to estimate consequent loading induced strains on forearm bone  shafts. Thirteen female physiotherapy students (mean 23.8 +/- 5.0 yrs, 166 +/- 7  cm, 64.4 +/- 7 cm, 64.4 +/- 13.3 kg) trained their left upper limbs with  dumbbells on average 2.8 times per week for 12 months, followed by eight months  detraining. Nineteen students served as controls (mean 25.7 +/- 5.2 yrs, 165 +/-  4 cm, 62.1 +/- 7.0 kg). BMC, BMD, and bone width and estimated cortical wall  thickness (CWT) were measured at five different sites in both upper extremities  (proximal humerus, humeral shaft, radial shaft, ulnar shaft, and distal forearm)  using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanner. In addition,  cross-sectional moment of inertia (CSMI) was estimated from DXA data. The  maximal isometric strength of the upper extremities was measured with an arm  flexion-extension dynamometer. The training increased significantly the flexion  strength by 14% (p = 0.001). During the detraining period, all measured strength  values in the training group decreased in both limbs with respect to values  after training. Despite the clear effect on muscular strength, no significant  intergroup differences were observed in BMC, BMD, bone width, CWT, or CSMI  values at any measured site after the training or detraining period. The  estimated loading-induced strains remained within customary loading, and the  change in strain level was only 15%. In conclusion, this study indicated that  using high-resistance strength training may not provide an effective osteogenic  stimulus for bone formation and geometric changes in upper limb bones of young,  healthy, adult women. The interaction of bones and muscles may play an important  and relatively unrecognized role in the development of bone strength, suggesting  that the entire biomechanical environment should be carefully considered when  evaluating the osteogenic efficiency of physical loading.

The effect of post-natal exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles.  Mørkved S(1), Bø K.  Author information: (1)Physiotherapy Department, Trondheim Regional Hospital, Trondheim, Norway.  BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effect of  post-natal pelvic floor muscle exercise. METHODS: A prospective comparison design comprising 66 matched pairs (n=132) of  mothers, divided into a training group (TG) and a control group (CG) was used.  The TG attended an eight week special pelvic floor muscle exercise course,  training in groups led by a physiotherapist 45 minutes once per week. In  addition they exercised at home at least three times per week. The CG followed  the ordinary written postnatal instructions provided by the hospital. Pelvic  floor muscle strength was measured at the 8th and the 16th week after delivery  using a vaginal balloon catheter connected to a pressure transducer. Vaginal  palpation and observation of inward movement of the balloon catheter during  contraction, were used to control the ability to perform correct pelvic floor  muscle contraction. In addition the women were interviewed about breast feeding,  menstruation, general physical activity and pelvic floor muscle exercise during  pregnancy, between birth and test l, and between test l and test 2.  Wilcoxon-Signed-Ranks-Test for matched pairs was performed to compare change in  pelvic floor muscle strength within and between groups. RESULTS: While a statistically significant change in pelvic floor muscle  strength was found in both the TG and the CG, the improvement for the training  group was significantly greater. CONCLUSION: was concluded that a specially devised pelvic floor muscle strength  training programme can add significantly to physical recovery after childbirth.

12319855,The age of menarche.,Rees M,"1. ORGYN. 1995;(4):2-4.  The age of menarche.  Rees M.  PIP: In females, the first menstrual period, menarche, signals the beginning of  the capacity to reproduce and is associated with the development of secondary  sexual characteristics. Menarche is one of the most significant milestones in a  woman's life. The first cycles tend to be anovulatory and vary widely in length.  They are usually painless and occur without warning. Menarche occurs between the  ages of 10 and 16 years in most girls in developed countries. Although the  precise determinants of menarcheal age remain to be understood, genetic  influences, socioeconomic conditions, general health and well-being, nutritional  status, certain types of exercise, seasonality, and family size possibly play a  role. Over the past century the age at menarche has fallen in industrialized  countries, but that trend has stopped and may even be reversing. The average age  at menarche in 1840 was 16.5 years, now it is 13. The age at menopause, however,  has remained relatively constant at approximately 50 years. The length of time  during which women are exposed to endogenous estrogen has therefore been  increasing. Reasons for the fall in menarcheal age remain unclear, but one  interpretation considers it to be a reflection of the improvement in health and  environmental conditions. The decline in menarcheal age appears to be leveling  off in many countries such as Britain, Iceland, Italy, Poland, and Sweden, but  continues in Germany and some other countries. Late menarche is associated with  a decreased risk of developing breast cancer in later life, a decreased  frequency of coronary heart disease, later first pregnancy, and reduction in  teen pregnancy. Late menarche may, however, be positively associated with the  risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.  PMID: 12319855 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Han M(1), Pan L, Wu B, Bian X.  Author information: (1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Peking Union Medical College  Hospital, Beijing.  A case-control study involving 203 cases of pelvic endometriosis seen from  1987-1989, and 406 randomly selected and age-matched community controls was  conducted in order to provide information relevant to effective prophylaxis of  the disease. The diagnosis was confirmed by pathology from laparotomy and/or  laparoscopy. A questionnaire focused on menstrual, marital and reproductive  status, professional exposure and physical activities, and the results were  analyzed by a conditional logistic regression model. Women characterized by  earlier menarche (< or = 12 years) and longer period (> or = 8 days) were found  to be associated with an elevated incurring risk, and a trend of increasing risk  associated with primary dysmenorrhea (RR = 2.1 for mild to moderate and RR = 5.2  for severe dysmenorrhea), energetic physical activity during menstruation (RR =  2.1), and allergic diathesis (RR = 1.8) was seen. An inverse relationship was  observed between the number of pregnancies and risk of endometriosis, and the  protective effect was most significant when only the number of full-term  pregnancies was counted. The risk factors of endometriosis are discussed, and  intensive treatment of primary dysmenorrhea and avoidance of strenuous exercise  during menstruation are identified as important measures in the prevention of  endometriosis.

Bone health and prevention of osteoporosis in active and athletic women.  Snow-Harter CM(1).  Author information: (1)Department of Exercise and Sport Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis.  Most studies have found lower bone mass among women with exercise-induced  oligomenorrhea compared with eumenorrheic control women and athletes. These  findings have important implications regarding increased risk of both stress  fractures and premature osteoporosis. Active and athletic women should be  encouraged to keep accurate records of their menstrual cycles. Any divergence  from normal should be noted and carefully followed. Bone mass evaluation by bone  densitometry for women with continued irregularities will allow assessment of  skeletal status. Recommendations for treatment can be based, in part, upon these  results, and follow-up scans will offer information on treatment efficacy. For  athletes experiencing loss of periods accompanied by low bone mass, a decrease  in training intensity and volume and an increase in total calories and calcium  intake (1200 to 1500 mg/day) may be indicated. The dietary alterations could be  accomplished by adding three glasses of skim milk per day to the diet. A program  of resistance training designed to increase both muscle strength and mass may  improve the skeletal profile of these athletes as well as protect against soft  tissue injuries. Finally, estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) may be indicated  for those women who are not willing to make changes in their exercise or dietary  patterns. Although there are currently no controlled trials that examine the  efficacy of ERT for treating these athletes, it is generally accepted that the  doses prescribed to postmenopausal women are adequate for reducing bone loss  among amenorrheic athletes. It is important that these women be followed with  bone mass and serum measurements in order to evaluate the efficacy of the  replacement therapy.  PMID: 8013040 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Effect of the different phases of the menstrual cycle and oral contraceptives on  athletic performance.  Lebrun CM(1).  Author information: (1)Allan McGavin Sports Medicine Centre, University of British Columbia,  Vancouver, Canada.  The female athlete, during her reproductive years, has a complex and  ever-changing milieu of female steroid hormones, whether it is the endogenous  variations in estradiol and progesterone of a regular menstrual cycle, or the  exogenous synthetic hormones of the oral contraceptives. Both estrogens and  progestins have individual, interactive and sometimes opposing physiological  actions with potential implications for the exercising female. In retrospective  surveys on the menstrual cycle and performance, from 37 to 63% of athletes did  not report any cycle 'phase' detriment, while 13 to 29% reported an improvement  during menstruation. The best performances were generally in the immediate  postmenstrual days, with the worse performances during the premenstrual interval  and the first few days of menstrual flow. However, this type of study has an  inherent built-in bias, and is further limited by the lack of substantiation of  cycle phase. Many of the women studied associated premenstrual symptoms, such as  fluid retention, weight gain, mood changes, and dysmenorrhoea with performance  decrement. Such factors have also been causally linked with an increase in  traumatic musculoskeletal injuries during the premenstrual and menstrual period.  Neuromuscular coordination, manual dexterity, judgement and reaction time for  complex tests have been shown to be adversely affected in women with  premenstrual syndrome or symptoms, but confounding variables may include  nutrition status and blood sugar levels. In addition, not all women suffer to  the same level with premenstrual symptoms. Fluctuations in many physiological  functions occur throughout the normal menstrual cycle. Results of early studies  are difficult to interpret owing to the small numbers of women studied, wide  range of fitness levels, and variability in the definitions of cycle phase.  Nevertheless, investigators did not document any significant changes in measures  of athletic performance as a function of timing of testing during the menstrual  cycle. Swimmers have shown a premenstrual worsening of performance times, with  improvement during the menstrual phase and on the eighth day of the cycle. An  increase in perceived exertion was noted premenstrually and during the early  menstrual stage with very intense exercise. In cross-country skiers, the best  times were recorded in the postovulatory and postmenstrual phases, prompting the  recommendation that training loads be selected according to cycle phase to  achieve maximum benefit. Investigations using estradiol and progesterone levels  as a confirmatory index of ovulation have not generally found significant  differences across the cycle in either maximal or submaximal exercise responses,  although a slight decrease in aerobic capacity during the luteal phase has been  reported.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)  DOI: 10.2165/00007256-199316060-00005 PMID: 8303141 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Low bone mineral density at axial and appendicular sites in amenorrheic  athletes.  Myburgh KH(1), Bachrach LK, Lewis B, Kent K, Marcus R.  Author information: (1)Musculoskeletal Research Laboratory, Department of Veterans Affairs Medical  Center, Palo Alto, CA 94304.  Amenorrheic athletes have low axial bone-mineral density (BMD, g.cm-2). We  compared 12 amenorrheic and 9 eumenorrheic women athletes to determine whether  athletes with amenorrhea have lower BMD in other skeletal regions, including  weight-bearing lower limbs. BMD was measured by dual energy x-ray and single  photon absorptiometry. Both groups had similar age, body mass, and exercise  quantity. Women with amenorrhea missed 86.3 +/- 58.3 menstrual periods since  menarche. BMD was lower in the amenorrheic vs eumenorrheic subjects for the  lumbar spine (0.928 +/- 0.056 vs 1.050 +/- 0.110, P < 0.005), whole body (1.032  +/- 0.05 vs 1.09 +/- 0.06, P < 0.05), most regions of the whole body (P <  0.05-0.001), all areas of the proximal femur (P < 0.005), and at the femoral  mid-shaft (1.333 +/- 0.109 vs 1.491 +/- 0.088, P < 0.005). No significant  differences were detected at the mid-radius and tibial shaft. The best  predictors of BMD were years of regular menstruation for lumbar spine; and years  of amenorrhea for hip, femoral mid-shaft, and whole body. We conclude that low  BMD in athletes with amenorrhea is not limited to the axial skeleton but is also  present in other regions including appendicular weight-bearing bones.

Estok PJ(1), Rudy EB, Kerr ME, Menzel L.  Author information: (1)Kent State University, School of Nursing, OH.  Overt (length of menstrual cycle, duration of menses, and amount of menses) and  covert (luteal surge indicative of ovulation and length of luteal phase)  menstrual cycle characteristics were studied in a sample of 146 women who  participated in four levels of running intensity. Menstrual and running data  were collected for 4 months or 3 cycles. There was a significant difference  among the four groups in duration of menses and in the amount of menses, with  nonrunners having significantly more days of menses and larger amounts of menses  than the two highest intensity running groups. However, when a history of  skipping menstrual periods between menarche and age 18 was controlled, the  differences between the groups were not significant. There were no significant  differences among the four groups in incidence of luteal surge or length of  luteal phase. When runners were compared to nonrunners, runners reported, on  average, a shorter luteal phase than nonrunners. This difference remained when  controlling for age and history of skipping menstrual periods. There was no  significant difference between the four groups on incidence of ovulatory  disturbances (anovulation or more than one cycle with a shortened luteal phase).  But, when compared to nonrunners, runners were found to have significantly more  ovulatory disturbances. The best predictors of the variance in menstrual cycle  characteristics were history of skipping periods between menarche and age 18,  and running versus nonrunning.

Bone density is compromised in amenorrheic women despite return of menses: a  2-year study.  Jonnavithula S(1), Warren MP, Fox RP, Lazaro MI.  Author information: (1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital, New  York, New York.  OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of estrogen deprivation on bone mass in  young women in whom large bone mass increases are known to occur. METHODS: Over 2 years, nine amenorrheic and 21 normal women were studied,  classified into exercising (dancers) and sedentary subjects. An integrated  estrogen exposure score was used to determine estrogen response during the 2  years of study. Bone mineral density was measured by single and dual photon  absorptiometry in the spine, wrist, and foot (metatarsus). RESULTS: Hypoestrogenism was present in all amenorrheic women in the first year,  and mean estrogen exposure scores were lower in these subjects during the 2  years. Mean spine, wrist, and metatarsal bone mineral density measurements were  lower in the amenorrheic women and remained below the levels in controls,  despite changing clinical indices and return of menses in some of the subjects.  Amenorrheic dancers showed the greatest increase in spine bone mineral density,  gaining 9.65% in the first year, 4.49% in the second, and an increase of 14.43%  (P < .05) over the total period. Their bone mineral density values, however,  remained significantly below those of normal controls during the duration of the  study. The most significant gains were seen in two subjects with weight gain and  return of irregular periods (three periods in 12 months). CONCLUSION: Young amenorrheic exercising women appear to increase bone mass  before the return of normal menses; however, bone mass remained below control  values during 2 years of study, possibly because of long-term adolescent  hypoestrogenism.

Hum Reprod. 1993 May;8(5):684-90. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.humrep.a138120.  Seasonality of reproductive function and weight loss in rural Nepali women.  Panter-Brick C(1), Lotstein DS, Ellison PT.  Author information: (1)Department of Anthropology, Durham University, UK.  Menstrual and hormonal disturbances have been reported in thin, dieting and  exercising Western women, and also recently in rural African women. A study of  salivary progesterone profiles was undertaken in a Nepali population to examine  whether seasonal increases in workload and changes in energy balance influenced  ovarian function. Women's energy expenditure levels were moderately heavy in the  winter and very heavy in the monsoon, and body mass fluctuated by -2.8 to +4.8  kg. Samples were collected from 24 normally menstruating women in two seasons,  each individual serving as her own control. Progesterone levels were  significantly depressed in the monsoon relative to winter for women who lost  weight, but not for women who gained weight, indicating that energy imbalance is  associated with a loss of fecundity. No differences in body mass index were  found between women who lost or gained weight. Progesterone levels were  age-dependent, and the degree of hormonal disturbance between age-groups was  related to weight loss. The study demonstrates seasonal changes in the fecundity  of hard-working Nepali women and a direct link between ovarian function and  weight loss (negative energy balance), which is independent of current  nutritional status.  PIP: In October-November 1990 and August-September 1991, anthropologists  collected saliva samples from 24 17-46 year old nonpregnant, nonlactating, and  normally menstruating Tamang women in a remote village in the foothills of the  Himalayas in northwestern Nepal to measure progesterone levels (indicative of  ovarian function). They used these levels to determine whether a very heavy  workload during the monsoon season and changes in dietary intake affected  ovarian function. Anthropometric measurements were also taken. The women served  as their own controls. Seasonal changes in body mass ranged from -2.8 kg to 4.8  kg. Mean and mid-luteal progesterone levels fell 27% (104-76 pmol/l) and 38%  (138-85 pmol/l), respectively, between the winter and monsoon (p .01). The  levels of ovarian function were much lower than those of healthy, regularly  menstruating Western women and of menstruating Lese women of the Ituri forest in  Zaire (mean luteal phase progesterone levels, 104 pmol/l vs. 232 pmol/l for  Boston women and 140 pmol/l for Lese women). Reduction in progesterone levels  was most significant for 24-34 year old women. In fact, the reduction in  mid-luteal progesterone levels was only significant in this age group (p .05).  Body mass index did not influence progesterone levels, regardless of changes in  weight or age. Reduced progesterone levels was only significant for women who  lost weight between the winter and the monsoon seasons, suggesting that energy  imbalance is linked to loss of fecundity. Younger women were more likely to gain  weight than older women (.6 kg vs. -1.1 kg for middle aged women and -.2 for  older women; p .05). The regression between changes in progesterone levels and  degree of weight loss was also significant (p .01). Between the winter and the  monsoon, the percentage of ovulatory cycles decreased from 71 to 38%. These  findings showed seasonal changes in the fecundity of these women and a direct  association between ovarian function and weight loss, regardless of current  nutritional status.

A case-control study, involving 203 cases of pelvic endometriosis and 406  randomly selected and age-matched community controls, was conducted. The results  showed that women characterized by earlier menarche (< or = 12 years) and longer  period (> 7 days) were associated with an elevated risk. Longer cycle (> 35  days) seemed to have a protective effect. There are a tendency to increasing  risk for endometriosis associated with primary dysmenorrhea and energetic  physical activities during menstruation. The results indicate that intensive  treatment of primary dysmenorrhea and avoidance of strenuous exercise during  menstruation may prevent pelvic endometriosis.

Author information: (1)Department of Medicine, University Hospital Virgen Macarena, Seville, Spain.  Hip fractures in elderly people are an important public health problem. The  incidence varies with ethnic group and shows wide geographical variation. To  examine the effect of body mass index, dietary calcium intake, fertile period,  physical activity, and years of education on the risk of hip fracture, a  case-control study was undertaken, as part of the MEDOS study, involving 519  women with hip fracture and 808 controls aged 50 or more years from Spain and  Turkey. The results of this study suggest that low body mass index, low dietary  calcium intake, low physical activity, a short fertile period, and a short  period of education are associated with increased risk of hip fracture. The  findings confirm previous reports of the influence of several potential risk  factors for hip fracture and demonstrate for the first time a protective effect  of education.

Beitins IZ(1), McArthur JW, Turnbull BA, Skrinar GS, Bullen BA.  Author information: (1)Department of Pediatrics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor 48109.  We have previously reported that during 2 months of strenuous exercise,  untrained young women with documented ovulatory menstrual cycles developed  secondary oligoamenorrhea and luteal phase defects. In this study we tested the  hypothesis that such abnormalities arise by altered neuroendocrine regulation of  menstrual hormone secretion and that weight loss potentiates such effects. We  supply a detailed analysis of the 20 cycles, of the total of 53, in which luteal  phase abnormalities occurred. During the control month and 2 exercise months,  all subjects collected daily overnight urine samples for the determination of  LH, FSH, estriol (E3), and free progesterone (P) excretion by RIAs and  creatinine by chemical assay. The characteristics of the abnormal luteal phase  cycles were determined by comparing the excreted hormone levels and patterns  during the control cycles with those of exercise cycles. The area under the  curve (AUC) for each hormone was calculated for the follicular and luteal phases  of each cycle. Six of the exercise cycles exhibited an inadequate luteal phase.  This was characterized by a mean integrated P area of 202.4 (SEM, -61.8)  nmol/day.nmol creatinine, compared with 331.7 (SEM, 64.7) during the  corresponding control cycles, over a period of 9 or more days after the urinary  LH peak to the onset of menses. Fourteen of the exercise cycles exhibited a  short luteal phase. This was characterized by a mean integrated P area of 75.9  (30.9) nmol/day.nmol creatinine, compared to 267 (61.7) during the corresponding  control cycles, over a span of 8 days or less from the urinary LH peak to the  onset of menses. Additional abnormalities occurred only in the short luteal  phase cycles. These included an increase in the length and AUC for E3 of the  follicular phase and a decrease in the AUC of LH during the luteal phase. We  conclude that the initiation of strenuous endurance training in previously  ovulating untrained women frequently leads to corpus luteum dysfunction  associated with insufficient P secretion and, in the case of short luteal phase  cycles, decreased luteal phase length. That exercise may alter the  neuroendocrine system is suggested by a delay in the ovulatory LH peak in spite  of increased E3 excretion; moreover, less LH is excreted during the luteal  phase. The lack of positive feedback to estrogens and decreased LH secretion  during the luteal phase could compromise corpus luteum function. In contrast,  decreased free P excretion was the sole abnormality noted in menstrual cycles  with an inadequate luteal phase.  DOI: 10.1210/jcem-72-6-1350 PMID: 1902847 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

The acute effects of submaximal endurance exercise (three consecutive 20-min  runs on a treadmill at 50, 60 and 70% of the subjects' maximum oxygen uptake)  upon the pulsatile release of LH were compared with those accompanying leisurely  strolling for a similar period in seven normally menstruating young women. All  trials were conducted during the early to mid-luteal phase, as determined by  body temperature patterns, ultrasonic scans of the ovaries, detection of the LH  surge in first morning urine specimens, and serial measurements of plasma  progesterone. Blood was sampled every 10 min via an indwelling cannula for 8 h  before and 12 h after exercise and serum LH measured by radioimmunoassay. LH  pulsations were analysed by a time series method. Following cannulation, mean LH  levels declined but then rose to reach a maximum 2 h before the beginning of the  exercise bout. LH concentrations remained virtually unchanged during exercise  itself, and exhibited a declining trend throughout the post-exercise period. The  findings in the two groups were similar in all respects, except that in the  control study the rate of LH pulsatility was significantly diminished (P less  than 0.05) during the first 2 h of sampling as compared with the subsequent 2-h  period. The approximate half-life of LH varied from 27 to 57 min, with a mean of  41 min.  DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-2265.1990.tb03757.x PMID: 2331808 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Author information: (1)Mayo Medical School, Rochester, Minnesota.  Dysfunctional uterine bleeding is classified by the character of the menstrual  cycle: ovulatory or anovulatory. Anovulation can occur at any age and is  physiologic in the first year or two after menarche and for several years before  menopause. Anovulatory cycles are characteristically irregular and marked by  prolonged episodes of bleeding unassociated with signs or symptoms of ovulation.  Specific causes of anovulation such as hyperprolactinemia, thyroid disease,  androgen excess, anorexia, obesity, and excess exercise can be treated  specifically; otherwise, therapy depends upon patient goals. Cycle regulation  can be affected by monthly courses of progestin, such as medroxyprogesterone  acetate (Provera), 10 mg daily for 10 days each month. Contraception and cycle  regulation can both be accomplished with oral contraceptives. Fertility, on the  other hand, will require ovulation induction. Ovulatory dysfunctional uterine  bleeding most prevalent in parous women between the ages of 20 and 40 is  associated with regular cycle intervals and premenstrual molimina. Midcycle and  perimenstrual spotting can often be treated with observation only, but depending  upon patient and/or physician concerns, periodic hormonal suppression is  effective. The management of menorrhagia should include the following: (1)  exclusion of pathology in the genital tract; (2) reduction in activity during  days of heavy flow; (3) the avoidance of aspirin in the week before and on days  of flow; (4) nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; (5) cycle suppression--oral  contraceptives, danazol (Danocrine), depo-progestin; (6) luteal phase progestin;  and (7) surgical intervention.

Author information: (1)Department of Community Medicine & General Practice, Radcliffe Infirmary,  Oxford, UK.  We attempted to identify all cases of benign ovarian teratoma which occurred in  two health districts in the UK during a 56 month period. The crude incidence was  8.9 cases/100,000 women. One hundred and twenty cases and 119 age-matched  controls were interviewed to identify risk factors for this disease. In  addition, 137 mothers completed postal questionnaires. Cases were older at  leaving school, had higher social class occupations, were more often unmarried  or married late, and had fewer children than controls. Oral contraceptive use  was similar for both. Cases reported more exercise at all ages, and more alcohol  consumption 1 year before diagnosis. Cases' mothers reported slightly less  nausea during pregnancy than controls' mothers, and none of the mothers reported  exogenous hormone exposure during the index pregnancy. In this study benign  ovarian teratomas strongly resemble testicular cancer in their age distribution  in the population. They also resemble testicular cancer in their association  with educational status and marital status. There was, however, no similarity  regarding prenatal hormone exposure. The increased risks associated with  exercise and alcohol use were unexpected; we need further information about how  these exposures affect the ovary, and whether they affect the testis.

Author information: (1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ohio State University, Columbus.  Norepinephrine plays a role in the regulation of luteinizing hormone secretion  and may therefore be involved in the etiology of exercise-induced menstrual  dysfunction. This study evaluated both intraexercise and postexercise responses  of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine in sedentary women and women  runners with normal and abnormal menstruation. Five eumenorrheic nonrunners and  five eumenorrheic, four oligomenorrheic, and five amenorrheic runners were  evaluated on 2 consecutive days. On day 1, the women cycled on a bicycle  ergometer against an increasing work load until exhaustion, and on day 2, the  women underwent a submaximal exercise regimen. Serial blood draws were taken at  specified time intervals during intraexercise and postexercise periods on both  days. The data collected during exercise for all groups showed that epinephrine  and norepinephrine had a sixfold to sevenfold rise on day 1 and had a threefold  rise on day 2. Dopamine increased twofold during both exercise protocols. On day  1 norepinephrine displayed a significantly higher percentage change from  baseline to peak levels for oligomenorrheic and amenorrheic runners than for  eumenorrheic runners and sedentary women. This latter finding is consistent with  the hypothesis that periodic marked elevations in norepinephrine levels during  maximal exercise may interfere with pulsatile luteinizing hormone release and  hence may play a role in the occurrence of menstrual dysfunction in women  runners.

Daily spot-checking versus chronobiologic monitoring of human differential  surface (rib versus breast) temperature.  Weydahl A, Halberg F.  A healthy, physically active woman, 35 years of age, living in Minneapolis,  automatically monitored her skin surface temperature (ST) 3 inches above each  nipple and on a rib below each breast for almost 3 months. In this paper a  portion of that period is analyzed, namely, from October 24, 1984 (day 1 of  menstruation) to November 16, 1984 (day 1 of next menstruation). On both sides,  the differences between the skin surface temperature over the rib and over the  breast (rib-breast DST) were calculated for each hour. The DST starts with a  negative value on day 1, then becomes less negative up to around day 6, when the  DST becomes positive. The means of DST during certain hours show extremely  variable patterns. Even by using DST along with changes in activity and  environmental temperature, circadian rhythms must be assessed. Around the clock  monitoring is more reliable than a daily 1-hr mean check at a fixed time of the  day. On the left side, DST mesors have a first macroscopic peak around days  8-10, another on day 14, and still others later in the cycle. On the right side,  DST mesors follow a similar pattern, changing from negative to positive values.  Peaking at day 10 is not as marked on the right side as on the left. The peak on  day 14 is clear for both sides. With around the clock monitoring and the  computation of the mesor of the differences between the temperatures at the two  sites, an increase around the ""estimated"" ovulation time may be expected if care  is also taken to account for the effects of periods of exercise and/or  environmental changes.

Bone mineral density after resumption of menses in amenorrheic athletes.  Drinkwater BL, Nilson K, Ott S, Chesnut CH 3rd.  Amenorrheic athletes have been found to have a lower vertebral bone mineral  density (BMD) than matched groups of eumenorrheic athletes. This study reports  changes in BMD over a 15.5 month period in athletes who regained menses,  athletes who remained amenorrheic, and athletes with regular cycles. The BMD was  measured at two sites on the radius and at the lumbar vertebrae (L-1 through  L-4), using single- and dual-photon densitometry, respectively. Changes in  vertebral BMD were significant for the amenorrheic group (+6.3%), but not for  cyclic women (-0.3%). A slight increase in radial density at S-1 and S-2 was not  significant for either group. Two athletes who remained amenorrheic during this  period continued to lose bone (-3.4%). We conclude that resumption of menses was  the primary factor for the significant increase in the vertebral BMD of the  formerly amenorrheic athletes.  PMID: 3723725 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

How I Manage Exercise-Related Menstrual Disturbances.  Shangold MM.  In brief: All women who stop menstruating or menstruate irregularly should be  examined. Amenorrhea and oligomenorrhea are often related to heavy exercise, but  in athletes as well as nonathletes these conditions can signal a serious  pathologic condition. Even athletes with regular periods can experience hormone  alterations, short luteal phase, or anovulation. Anovulation and hypoestrogenism  are the two major conditions experienced by women with oligomenorrhea and  amenorrhea. Anovulation may lead to endometrial pathology and an increased risk  of breast cancer, while hypoestrogenism increases the risk of developing  osteoporosis. Tests to pinpoint the causes of menstrual dysfunctions and measure  estrogen levels are listed, and treatments to establish a proper balance of  estrogen and progesterone are described.

Cumming DC, Vickovic MM, Wall SR, Fluker MR, Belcastro AN.  Endurance exercise has been associated with reproductive dysfunction. We have  previously suggested that pulsatile release of luteinizing hormone is impaired  at rest in normal menstruating runners compared with sedentary women. To  determine whether acute exercise had any effect on pulsatile release of  luteinizing hormone we investigated serum luteinizing hormone levels in six  normal menstruating runners at rest and after 60 minutes of running exercise.  Exercise induced an increment in circulating luteinizing hormone levels greater  than the change in hematocrit. The luteinizing hormone pulse frequency,  calculated as the number of luteinizing hormone pulses per 6 hours, was reduced  after exercise compared with values obtained at rest. There was no significant  difference in pulse amplitude or area under the 6-hour curve between resting and  postexercise situations. These data suggest that acute exercise has an  inhibitory effect on luteinizing hormone pulsatile release at the hypothalamic  level in eumenorrheic runners that is in addition to the previously described  effect of training.

Bullen BA, Skrinar GS, Beitins IZ, von Mering G, Turnbull BA, McArthur JW.  We performed a prospective study of 28 initially untrained college women with  documented ovulation and luteal adequacy to determine whether strenuous exercise  spanning two menstrual cycles would induce menstrual disorders. To ascertain the  influence, if any, that weight loss might exert, we randomly assigned the  subjects to weight-loss and weight-maintenance groups. Subjects were expected to  run 4 miles (6.4 km) per day, progressing to 10 miles (16.1 km) per day by the  fifth week, and to engage daily in 31/2 hours of moderate-intensity sports. The  normalcy of the menstrual cycles during the period of exercise was judged  independently according to clinical and hormonal criteria, the latter comprising  serial measurements of gonadotropin and sex-steroid excretion. A higher  percentage of abnormalities proved to be detectable by hormonal means (P less  than 0.02). Only four subjects (three in the weight-maintenance group) had a  normal menstrual cycle during training. In the weight-loss group, the number of  women who had luteal abnormalities as compared with those who lost the surge in  luteinizing hormone altered significantly over time, the latter occurring more  frequently (P less than 0.01) as training progressed. Within six months of  termination of the study, all subjects were again experiencing normal menstrual  cycles. We conclude that vigorous exercise, particularly if compounded by weight  loss, can reversibly disturb reproductive function in women.

Findings reaffirmed the  notion that scant menstrual flow, skipped menses, and menstrual irregularity are  significantly related to the intensity of jogging; age at menarche, infertility,  and uterine prolapse were not. Thirty-two percent of the women felt that jogging  decreased their menstrual discomfort, and 44% reported better jogging  performance right after or between menstrual periods.

Bullen BA, Skrinar GS, Beitins IZ, Carr DB, Reppert SM, Dotson CO, Fencl MD,  Gervino EV, McArthur JW.  A prospective study of the hormonal effects of a moderate exercise training  program (4-wk control, 8-wk training) was conducted in seven young women.  Sixty-minutes continuous bicycle ergometer tests of fixed relative intensity  were performed at the beginning, middle, and end of the training period. The  capacity of these acute bouts of exercise to affect circulating levels of stress  markers, reproductive hormones, and hormones with possible antireproductive  potential was measured. In addition, the urinary excretion of reproductive  hormones was monitored continuously via serial overnight urine collections.  Within testing sessions, plasma concentrations of all stress markers and  antireproductive hormones rose significantly. Across testing sessions, only  beta-endorphin + beta-lipotropin and cortisol exhibited an increment in peak  responses as training progressed. Plasma reproductive hormone levels showed  insignificant acute changes, and cyclic menstruation and preovulatory  gonadotropin surges continued in all subjects. However, ovarian function was  disturbed in four subjects as evidenced by a decreased excretion of estriol,  free progesterone, or both. Transient infertility is a known clinical  accompaniment of hormonal changes of comparable subtlety.  DOI: 10.1152/jappl.1984.56.6.1453 PMID: 6735803 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"
6352131,"Exercise, sports, and menstrual dysfunction.",Hale RW,"1. Clin Obstet Gynecol. 1983 Sep;26(3):728-35.  Exercise, sports, and menstrual dysfunction.  Hale RW.  With the increasing involvement of women in exercise programs, the physician is  faced with more and more questions regarding the effect of exercise upon the  reproductive system. Currently, it appears that premenarchal training may have  the effect of delaying the onset of menses in some girls. There is no evidence  that it delays the other stage of puberty or that it causes any harmful  development by this delay. In the postmenarchal woman, strenuous exercise can  definitely alter her bleeding pattern. The usual result is oligomenorrhea  progressing toward amenorrhea as the exercise increases. This is not a universal  phenomenon, however, and other factors such as percentage of body fat, stress,  diet, and energy drain also play a role. The menses will usually resume its  preexercise pattern after a period of rest.  PMID: 6352131 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Menstrual dysfunction characterized by delayed menarche, irregular menses, or  secondary amenorrhea often affects women who compete in athletics over a  prolonged time. Loss of body fat and emotional stress are important predisposing  factors. Under these circumstances, hypoestrogenism, an altered ratio of  follicle-stimulating hormone to luteinizing hormone, and elevation of serum  testosterone, prolactin, catecholamines, and opioids are fairly common. There is  controversy over whether the working capacity and performance of the average  woman varies appreciably during various phases of the menstrual cycle.  Apparently, those who suffer from premenstrual tension do have a diminution in  working capacity. Generally, the causes of menstrual dysfunction are the same  for athletes and nonathletes, and there are currently no data to forbid  athletes' training at any time during the menses. A gynecologic examination  should be done before menstrual dysfunction is considered to be due to physical  exercise. If this assumption is substantiated, and if amenorrhea persists for  one year or more, a periodic estrogen-progesterone regimen should be offered to  minimize vascular problems, osteoporosis, and stress fractures, and to protect  the endometrium and ovarian function.

Menstrual cycle and basal metabolic rate in women.  Solomon SJ, Kurzer MS, Calloway DH.  Basal metabolic rate, resting metabolic rate (RMR), and energy cost of selected  activities were measured in six healthy young women who were participating in a  study of protein requirements. The women were confined to a metabolic unit for  92 days during which they consumed a defined formula diet. The basal metabolic  rate of the women was 20.7 +/- 2.6 kcal/kg body weight/day and the caloric  requirement for maintenance of weight was 38.7 kcal/kg body weight/day. Basal  metabolic rate varied significantly with the menstrual cycle. Basal metabolic  rate decreased at menstruation and fell to its lowest point approximately 1 wk  before ovulation subsequently rising until the beginning of the next menstrual  period. RMR was 0.99 +/- 0.16 kcal/kg/h. The energy expenditure while sitting  was 1.06 times RMR, while walking it was 2.81 times RMR, and while performing  treadmill exercise it was 3.47 times RMR.

Prevalence of oligomenorrhea and amenorrhea in a college population.  Bachmann GA, Kemmann E.  Menstrual disorders in college students have been reported as higher than in the  general population. Several reasons, among them calorie-restricted diets,  strenuous exercise, and college-related stress, have been attributed to this  increased prevalence. During the period November, 1979, to January, 1980, 991 of  1,420 college students completed questionnaires which inquired about their  menstrual history. The prevalence of oligomenorrhea in this group was 11.3% and  that of amenorrhea was 2.6%. Significant factors associated with oligomenorrhea  or amenorrhea in this group were weight loss (greater than 20 pounds) and  jogging. In most women with oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, menstrual irregularity  was present prior to college entry. With the use of self-administered  questionnaires, we could not identify any specific college stress to account for  the presence of menstrual abnormalities in a college population.

Changes in the metabolic cost of standardized work associated with the use of an  oral contraceptive.  McNeill AW, Mozingo E.  PIP: This study was conducted to examine the metabolic effect of predetermined,  standardized submaximal work loads in relation to the use of an oral  contraceptive (OC). A repeated measures design was selected for use in the  study. The subjects were 11 female nonathletes, aged 19-20 of relatively  constant weight (pretest mean 58.9 kg, posttest mean 59.6 kg) with no apparent  water retention at any phase of the menstrual cycle. Subjects were given  Norlestrin 21 (1 mg) and were asked to maintain their normal activity and  dietary patterns and to refrain from using other medications within 24 hours of  any testing period. Each subject was tested on the 4th, 10th and 26th day of her  cycle. Workloads were established at 300 and 600 kpm per minute. A Monark  bicycle ergometer was used, with cadence established at 50 revolutions/minute.  Each subject was required to exercise for a period of 6 minutes or longer until  their heart rate reached a steady state. Oxygen consumption determinations were  made for 2 consecutive 30 second intervals after steady state had been reached.  Open circuit respirometry was used to determine values for VO2. Data analysis  was accomplished using a 3x2x2 factorial arrangement of treatments in a  randomized complete block design (blocks = women). The findings show that there  was a significant increase in the oxygen consumption for standardized work loads  of 300 and 600 kpm. The lack of significance among the various interactions  leads to the conclusion that the use of Norlestrin 21 was accompanied by a  significant increase in the oxygen consumption during the performance of  standardized work at these 3 phases of the menstrual cycle. These results  support the theory that the use of OCs is accompanied by a shift in the mixture  of substrates utilized for submaximal work and that this shift is toward an  increased dependence upon triglycerides and a decreased dependence on glycogen.  These findings provide a basis upon which to question the value of OCs as a tool  to manipulate the menstrual cycle for the purpose of athletic competition.  PMID: 7321554 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Baker ER, Mathur RS, Kirk RF, Williamson HO.  Twenty-three white women, ages 18 to 42, with normal menses prior to running  were studied. Miles per week varied from 10 to 70 for a period of 1 to more than  10 years. Of these, 6 were amenorrheic (AM), 14 had regular cycles (REG), and 3  with regular cycles became amenorrheic during the course of this study. The  incidence of amenorrhea was higher in those less than 30 years of age (66.6%)  than in the older group (9.0%); in those who ran 40 miles/week or less (37.5%)  than in those who ran more (26.6%); and in the nulliparous (46.6%) than in the  parous runners (25.0%). The age of menarche was significantly higher in the AM  (13.8 +/- 0.5 years) than in the REG (12.2 +/- 0.3 years). Blood samples were  collected between 12 and 24 hours after the last run for hormonal and  sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) measurements. Plasma estradiol (E2), SHBG,  and LH were significantly lower in the AM than in the REG group. Furthermore,  E2, LH, and prolactin were significantly lower in the AM group than in the  control group. These results suggest that the incidence of secondary amenorrhea  is higher in younger, nulliparous female runners and may be related to delayed  onset of menarche.

Schoene RB, Robertson HT, Pierson DJ, Peterson AP.  To investigate the influence of the midluteal and midfollicular phases of the  menstrual cycle on exercise performance and ventilatory drives, we studied six  outstanding female athletes, six controls with normal menstrual cycles, and six  outstanding athletes who were amenorrheic. In all menstruating subjects resting  minute ventilation (Ve) and mouth occlusion pressures (P0.1) were higher in the  luteal phase (p less than k0.0001 and p less than 0.02, respectively),. Hypoxic  (expressed as the hyperbolic shape parameter A) and hypercapnic (expressed as S,  deltaVE/delta PAco2) ventilatory responses were increase in the luteal phase (p  less than 0.01). The athletes had lower A values during the luteal phase than  the nonathletes (p less than 0.001). Maximal exercise response, expressed either  as total exercise time or maximum O2 consumption or CO2 production (VO2 max or  Vco2 max) was decreased during the luteal phase but was significantly different  at a p less than 0.05 level only among the nonathletes. Ventilatory equivalent  (VE/VO2) during progressive exercise on a bicycle ergometer was significantly  increased during the luteal phase. The amenorrheic athletes showed no changes  between the two test periods. The luteal phase of the menstrual cycle induced  increases in ventilatory drives and exercise ventilation in both athletes and  controls, but the athletes, in contrast to controls, demonstrated no significant  decrease in exercise performance in the luteal phase.

We have studied the effects of short-term exercise on the degradation rate of  estradiol (E2) measured as the metabolic clearance rate (MCRE2). Six young women  (mean age 20.7 yr) volunteered for this study in which we investigated the  influence of a submaximal bicycle ergometer load on the MCRE2. All measurements  were done in the morning of the 7th to 10th day of the menstrual cycle.  [3H]estradiol 17 beta ([3H]E2) was administered intravenously at a constant rate  by an infusion pump. During the exercise period on the bicycle ergometer (70%  VO2max, 10 min) and the recovery period (25% VO2max, 30 min), several blood  samples were taken in which the [3H]E2 concentration was estimated. The results  showed a strong decrease in the MCRE2 (range 18-67%) at the end of the work load  for all the volunteers. At the end of the recovery period, the MCR was still  lower than the basal value (range 30-50%). The possible mechanisms and relevance  of these exercise-induced MCR changes of estradiol are discussed.  DOI: 10.1152/jappl.1980.48.5.765 PMID: 7451283 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

The effect of physical training on the serum iron levels of college-age women.  Wirth JC, Lohman TG, Avallone JP Jr, Shire T, Boileau RA.  Physical training in women has been found to be associated with a significant  decrease in serum iron levels suggesting a state of deteriorating iron stores.  To further study this phenomenon, seventeen women, aged 19 to 23 years,  volunteered to participate in a 10-week physical training program to study the  effect of training on serum iron levels. The training consisted of three 20-25  minute exercise bouts per week on a bicycle ergometer with individual workloads  equivalent to approximately 70% of each subject's maximum aerobic capacity.  Additionally, eight women, aged 19 to 28, volunteered to act as a control group.  Assessments of hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), serum iron (SeFe), and maximum  oxygen uptake (Vo2 max) were made on both groups prior to and at the conclusion  of the training period. Upon completion of training, Vo2 max (ml/kg/min)  increased by eleven percent (p less than .05) whereas Gb and Hct showed no  significant changes for the trainign group with respect to the control group. Se  Fe levels (microgram/100ml) in the training group did not differ significantly  from those of the control group in both pre-training (128.8 +/- 7.6 vs 103.7 +/-  13.7, X +/- SE) and post-training (126.6 +/- 7.9 vs. 120.9 +/- 16.3, X +/- SE)  conditions. Neither day of menstrual cycle nor use of oral contraceptives nor  use of iron supplements was found to have any systematic effect on SeFe levels.  The results suggest that short term physical training in college-age women does  not significantly lower SeFe levels.  PMID: 723516 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Accordingly, the oxygenated mixed venous CO2 tension was  measured in 202 healthy volunteers and the influence of potentially disturbing  factors such as intake of coffee and food, exercise and menstruation on the  stability of this tension was studied in selected subjects. In the 102 men the  mean value was 5.1 mm Hg (SD, 2.9 mm Hg), significantly higher (P less than  0.001) than that of the 100 women, 46.03 mm Hg (SD, 2.48 mm Hg).

PIP: Fasting growth hormone (GH) levels and GH responses to exercise in normally  menstruating women were compared with those in women taking combination-type  oral contraceptives (OCs). Exercise on a bicycle ergometer was performed on Days  2-4 of menstruation and on Days 12-15. GH response to exercise was higher around  the time of ovulation than at the time of menstruation; the difference was  significant at all exercise times and at 5 and 10 minutes after exercise (.05  more than p more than .001). The prestimulation values were low during the 2  cycle periods studied (2 ng/ml and 1.8 ng/ml, respectively). Mean GH levels were  low at the time of the luteinizing hormone peak and pre- and postovulatory serum  GH levels were similar during the 21 days of OC therapy. The GH responses to  exercise in normally menstruating women and in women taking OCs were similar on  Cycle Days 5, 10, 20, and 25. It is concluded that the GH response to exercise,  but not GH levels, were related to the menstrual cycle. The OCs in this study  did not alter GH responses and levels by long-term therapy.
