BACKGROUND: Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a common disorder affecting women of  reproductive age. The severity and persistence of PMS may cause deterioration of  physical, social and psychological balance and affect relationships and  performance in the workplace. OBJECTIVE: The majority of those working in health care services during the  COVID-19 pandemic were women therefore the aim of this study was to investigate  the differences and relationship between anxiety sensitivity (AS), perceived  stress, personality traits with and without the presence of PMS in young adult  women healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic period. METHODS: This study consisted of 1008 participants. The following data were  collected: PMS, AS Index-3, Perceived Stress Scale, Revised Eysenck Personality  Questionnaire, sociodemographic data, and menstruation characteristics. RESULTS: Women with PMS had higher AS (27.64 ± 15.55 vs. 16.51 ± 11.20) and  perceived stress (23.52 ± 6.67 vs. 19.16 ± 5.24) levels than women without PMS.  The mean neuroticism (4.20 ± 1.72 vs. 3.19 ± 1.81) and psychoticism (1.74 ± 1.06  vs. 1.51 ± 1.24) scores were higher and the mean extraversion score (3.87 ± 1.73  vs. 3.98 ± 1.77) was lower in women with PMS than in those without PMS. PMSS  exhibited a statistically significant, moderate, positive correlation with the  ASI-3 (r = .414, p < .001) and PSS (r = .487, p < .001) scores. Furthermore,  PMSS exhibited a weak positive correlation with the neuroticism (r = .236,  p < .001) and psychoticism (r = .219, p < .001) subscales and a moderate  negative correlation with the extraversion (r = -.560, p = .015) subscale. As  the PMSS score increased, the ASI, PSS, neuroticism, and psychoticism scores  increased. However, the extraversion score decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Young adult women will benefit from psychotherapeutic and  educational interventions to manage PMS, which will minimize the number of  physical and psychological issues they experience.

Previous reports suggest that the menstrual cycle (MC) phases can impact  cortisol concentrations. However, research is needed on whether the MC impacts  other markers of stress and immune function. It has also been shown that some  biomarkers are impacted by time of day, although differences between morning  (AM) and afternoon (PM) biomarkers have not been studied over the course of the  MC. This study assessed the effect of MC phases and time of day on salivary  stress biomarkers [salivary α-amylase (sAA), secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA)],  progesterone, resting blood pressure and resting heart rate (RHR). A  single-group repeated measure design was employed in which seventeen  participants (n = 17) monitored their MC for two months while attending eight  experimental sessions which included both AM and PM sessions during each  predicted 1) menses, 2) follicular, 3) ovulatory and 4) luteal phases. Resting  blood pressures, heart rates, body composition parameters (assessed via  bioelectrical impedance analysis), sAA and SIgA concentrations were assessed. No  time of day x MC phase interactions (p > 0.05) were noted for sAA or SIgA,  resting blood pressure, heart rate, or body composition parameters. However, sAA  and RHR were significantly higher in the PM, while SIgA was significantly higher  in the AM. These data suggest that the MC phases do not impact sAA or SIgA,  resting blood pressure, heart rates, or body composition parameters. However,  time-of-day impacts RHR and concentrations of sAA and SIgA. These findings  provide implications for female participants in research dealing with these  biomarkers.

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrinological disorder that  affects women of reproductive age and can lead to infertility. The prevalence of  PCOS ranges from 5-21% depending on the diagnostic criteria and study  population. Clinical manifestations include irregular or absent menstrual  periods, obesity, and signs of hyperandrogenism. PCOS can also lead to long-term  consequences such as metabolic syndrome, increased risk of cardiovascular  diseases, endometrial cancer, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. Metformin and  oral contraceptive pills are the most commonly used drugs for PCOS management,  but their efficiency is limited and they have some considerable side effects.  Researchers are looking into alternative therapeutic options such as  phytochemicals. Curcumin (CUR) is a polyphenolic compound found in the rhizome  of Curcuma longa and has shown promising effects for females with PCOS. CUR  exerts its anti-PCOS effects through different mechanisms such as reducing  oxidative stress and inflammation, balancing hormone levels, and controlling the  blood sugar and lipid profile. It can also reduce insulin resistance, regulate  menstruation, and improve ovarian morphology and function. Despite its  beneficial effects, CUR faces several challenges and limitations in clinical  use, such as low bioavailability, instability, and rapid elimination. Therefore,  researchers are investigating the potential of CUR nanoformulations and new drug  delivery systems to overcome these barriers. With growing evidence regarding the  potential role of CUR in PCOS treatment, we decided to provide an updated  summary of the recent literature from clinical and preclinical studies on this  topic.

BACKGROUND: Women may be vulnerable to elevated depressive symptoms during the  menopause transition (MT). Studies generally have not considered premenopausal  depressive symptom history or examined symptoms in relation to the final  menstrual period (FMP). OBJECTIVE: To identify specific time points in relation to the FMP when  depressive symptoms increase or decrease. METHODS: Participants were 1582 multiracial/ethnic women from the longitudinal  Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN). Biological, psychosocial, and  depressive symptom data were collected approximately annually. Depressive  symptoms were measured by the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression  (CESD) scale. RESULTS: Women with high baseline depressive symptoms (CES-D ≥ 16) declined in  symptoms (M = -1.04/yr., 95 % CI = -1.58, -0.50) until 4 years before the FMP,  followed by a smaller decrease (M = -0.50/yr., 95 % CI = -0.72, -0.28) until  18 months after the FMP. Depressive symptoms increased (M = 0.21/yr., 95 %  CI = 0.11, 0.30) in those with low baseline symptoms until 1 year before the  FMP, and decreased (M = -0.06/yr., 95 % CI = -0.11, -0.008) going forward.  Greater social support, higher levels of follicle stimulating hormone and  estradiol, and less sleep disturbance contributed to greater decline in  depressive symptoms among those with high baseline depressive symptoms. Anxiety,  experiencing stressful life events, lower body mass index, and poor  role-physical function contributed to an increase in depressive symptoms among  those with low baseline symptoms. LIMITATIONS: Excluded women had higher baseline CES-D scores. Lacked pre-MT  depression for pre/early perimenopausal women at baseline. CONCLUSION: Accounting for baseline depressive symptom level and focusing on the  FMP more precisely characterize depressive symptom change over the MT.  Copyright © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

Activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis can  disrupt ovarian cyclicity. Estrogens can modulate stress responsiveness and  mood. Thus, understanding this interaction and how it modulates the menstrual  cycle is crucial for women's reproductive health. PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to analyze the influence of a stressor,  a period of the Covid-19 pandemic when there were no vaccines available yet, on  the psychological state of women aged 18 to 45 years; as well as the influence  of mental health on the menstrual cycle, considering the influence of age and  hormonal contraceptives. METHOD: Online questionnaire using the Google Forms platform was used. RESULTS: There is a high prevalence of the onset of new psychosocial symptoms.  Moreover, most women reported some type of change in their menstrual cycles. The  women who were using hormonal contraceptives demonstrated a higher frequency of  spotting and menstrual color alterations, while women without hormonal  contraceptives demonstrated a higher frequency of cycle duration and menstrual  odor alterations. Women without hormonal contraceptives were more susceptible to  the development of psychosocial symptoms. Younger adult women were more affected  by menstrual changes and psychosocial symptoms. Close to 90% of women who  reported several psychosocial symptoms had changes in their menstrual cycles. CONCLUSION: These data suggest the impact of stressors, such as a period of the  pandemic, on mental health and menstrual cycles, and younger adult women can be  more susceptible. This reflects the relationship between mental and reproductive  health.  © 2024. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria,  part of Springer Nature.

BACKGROUND: Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a debilitating condition,  affecting women of reproductive age. It is characterized by severe periodic  physical and psychological symptoms, which end after the onset of menstruation.  This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of emotion-focused therapy (EFT)  for PMDD patients. METHODS: A total of 48 PMDD women, in the age range of 18-44 years, were  randomly assigned to two intervention and control groups. The intervention group  participated in 16 weeks of EFT treatment, while the control group was selected  based on the waiting list (waitlist control group) and followed-up after three  months. Forty-four patients finally completed this study. The participants  completed the Premenstrual Syndrome Screening Tool (PSST), Difficulties in  Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21  (DASS-21) in the first premenstrual period before treatment, the first  premenstrual period after treatment, and the premenstrual period three months  after treatment. RESULTS: Based on the repeated measure analysis of variances, the total score of  DERS and the total score of PSST decreased significantly (P < 0.05). Also, in  DASS-21, the scores of depression and stress subscales reduced significantly  (P < 0.05), while there was no significant decrease in the score of anxiety  subscale (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Based on the present results, EFT can be an effective treatment for  alleviating the symptoms of PMDD. This treatment can reduce the emotion  regulation difficulties of women with PMDD and alleviate the symptoms of  depression and stress.

Women suffer from various conditions related to menstrual cycle due to changing  lifestyle, bad food habits, physical and mental stress. Pre Menstrual Syndrome  (PMS) is a combination of physical and emotional symptoms that many women get  one or two weeks before the start of their menstrual period. In the present  study, 14 years old female patient having symptoms-lower abdominal pain,  backache, breast tenderness, constipation, pimples, tiredness and unexplained  anger typically in luteal phase from last 4 months, was diagnosed with mild to  moderate symptoms of PMS. After proper analysis, she was suggested to consume  light to digest dietary articles advised in classical texts for minimizing  specific symptoms during menstruation.Thus Green gram Soup and Barley porridge  was prescribed to her as lunch and dinner respectively for first three days of  menstruation cycle for continuous 6 cycles. It is observed that consumption of  these dietary products during the menstruation time period assisted to minimize  the symptoms of PMS. This illustrates that there is a wide scope to explore the  ayurvedic dietary regimen recommended during menstruation which can be used more  rationally to suit menstrual disorders.

Oxidative stress maybe involved in the patho-etiology of menstrual-associated  complications. Curcuminoids, are polyphenolic natural compounds that have  potentially important functional activities. This triple-blind, randomized,  placebo-controlled trial was performed to investigate the effects of a  curcuminoids on oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity in girls with  premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and dysmenorrhea. Eighty young girls with both PMS  and dysmenorrhea were randomly given either curcuminoids (500 mg+5 mg piperine)  or a placebo daily, for a period from 7 days pre- until 3 days post- initiation  of menstrual bleeding for 3 successive menstrual cycles. The total antioxidant  capacity and free radical scavenging activity of serum and urine were quantified  via ferric reducing/antioxidant power (FRAP) and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl  (DPPH) methods, respectively. There were no significant differences between the  placebo and curcumin groups, with respect to the age, dietary intake and  biochemical/anthropometric indices (p>0.05). The curcumin treatment  significantly increased the free-radical scavenging activity of serum compared  to the treatment with placebo (p=0.031). Although, no significant changes were  found in serum and urinary levels of FRAP, DPPH and MDA between the groups  (p>0.05). Curcumin treatment did increase free-radical scavenging activity and  antioxidant potential in girls with PMS and dysmenorrhea. Investigations with  higher doses and duration of curcumin are required to verify our findings.  © Chonnam Medical Journal, 2024.

BACKGROUND: In initial COVID-19 clinical trials, menstrual health was not  formally monitored, yet anecdotal reports of menstruation changes surfaced on  social media. This study aims to assess the association between COVID-19  vaccines and menstruation using Clue, a period-tracking application. STUDY DESIGN: A survey assessing demographics, menstrual health, stress levels,  and COVID-19 vaccination was sent to Clue users between 12/7/2021 and 2/9/2022.  Inclusion criteria were (1) 18 years or older (2) currently menstruating (3) not  pregnant or breastfeeding since 1/2020. Menstrual data was collected for each  participant. Users with cycle lengths more than 90 days were excluded. Cycle  lengths were calculated for the 6-month average pre-vaccination (PRIOR), the  cycle during which vaccination was administered (DURING), the cycle following  DURING (AFTER1), and the cycle following AFTER1 (AFTER2). For periods,  individuals were stratified based on whether vaccination was received during  their menstrual period (DURING). Period lengths were additionally calculated for  the 6-month average pre-vaccination (PRIOR), the first period following  vaccination (AFTER1), and the period following AFTER1 (AFTER2). For unvaccinated  participants, an index date (4/1/2022) was used to similarly designate menstrual  cycles and periods. For each participant, cycle length changes for DURING,  AFTER1, and AFTER2 compared to PRIOR were determined. Student's t-test compared  the mean of these changes between vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. RESULTS: Of 7,559 participants, 6,897 (91 %) were vaccinated. Compared to PRIOR,  individuals vaccinated during their menstrual period demonstrated a  statistically significant increase in the DURING period length, but not AFTER1  (p = 0.463) and AFTER2 (p = 0.692). No statistically significant changes were  observed in period lengths of those vaccinated in between periods or in cycle  lengths overall. CONCLUSION: A small but statistically significant change in period length was  observed only in individuals vaccinated for COVID-19 during their menstrual  period. Providers can better counsel menstruating individuals to reduce vaccine  misinformation.  © 2024 The Authors.

OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the presence, importance, and characteristics of  menstrual changes related to stressful circumstances during the COVID-19  lockdown in Spain. STUDY DESIGN: An online survey was administered in Spain to menstruating women  aged 15-55 who had not contracted COVID-19. It collected information on  activities during the lockdown, sexual activity, perceptions of emotional  status, any changes in menstrual characteristics, and impact on quality of life.  The analysis of menstrual changes was limited to responders who did not use  hormonal contraception. RESULTS: A total of 6449 women answered the survey, and 4989 surveys were valid  for the final analysis. 92.3% of women had at least one menstruation period  during the lockdown, while 7.7% had amenorrhea. Quality of life (QoL) associated  with menstruation worsened in 19% of women, did not change in 71.7%, and  improved in 1.6%. For 50.1% of the women, global QoL worsened during the  lockdown; 41.3% remained about the same and 8.7% reported improvement. Sexual  activity during the lockdown decreased in 49.8% of the respondents, remained  unchanged in 40.7%, and increased in 9.5%. As far the menstrual changes are  concerned, there were no statistically significant differences in amenorrhea  incidence, regularity of the menstrual cycle, or the amount or duration of  menstrual bleeding in non-hormonal contraceptive users when evaluated by the  length and characteristics of isolation, the perception of exposure to COVID-19  and the economic or employment situation. Conversely, we found statistically  significant differences according to the intensity of changes in emotional  status due to lockdown stressors and changes in regularity, duration, and  heaviness of menstruation. CONCLUSION: Changes in emotional status, but not the length and intensity of the  isolation or exposure to the disease, significantly influenced menstrual  disturbances during the COVID-19 lockdown.

BACKGROUND: The sars-Cov-2 pandemic has determined psychological stress,  particularly in the young population of medical students. We studied the impact  of the pandemic on menstrual cycle alteration in relation to psychological  stress, presence of depression, sleep disturbances and post-traumatic stress, on  a population of medical students. METHODS: 293 female students at the Faculty of Medicine and Psychology of the  Sapienza University of Rome (23.08 years old ± 3.8) were enrolled. In March  2021, one year after quarantine, a personal data sheet on menstrual cycle,  examining the quality of the menstrual cycle during the pandemic, compared to  the previous period. Concomitantly, the Beck Depression Inventory and the Impact  of Event Scale have been administered. A Pearson chi-square test was assessed to  evaluate the difference between the characteristics of the menstrual cycle and  the scores obtained with the questionnaires. RESULTS: A statistically significant association between menstrual alterations  and stress during pandemic had been found. The onset of depressive symptoms and  sleep disturbances was observed in 57.1% and in 58.1% of young women with  cycle's alterations, respectively. Amenorrhea was three times more common in  female students with depressive symptoms, premenstrual syndrome had a  significant correlation with both depression and sleep disturbances. The  pandemic has been related to menstrual alterations, with depressive symptoms and  sleep disorders. Amenorrhea is connected to depression, as observed on the  functional hypothalamic amenorrhea. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic affected the menstrual cycle as well as the depressive  symptoms and sleep. Practical implications of the study lead to the development  of strategies for psychological intervention during the pandemic experience, in  order to help medical trainees, with specific attention to women's needs. Future  studies should analyze the impact of other types of social stress events, on  sleep, depression and the menstrual cycle beside the pandemic.  © 2024. The Author(s).

Liguori F(1), Saraiello E(1), Calella P(1).  Author information: (1)Department of Medical, Movement Sciences and Wellbeing, University of Naples  ""Parthenope"", 80133 Naples, Italy.  Most women who menstruate experience various physical, psychological, and  behavioral changes during the period between ovulation and menstruation. This  study focuses on defining and diagnosing premenstrual disorders, distinguishing  between premenstrual symptoms (PS), PMS, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder  (PMDD). It highlights the prevalence of these conditions and their impact on  women's quality of life, including social, occupational, and psychological  aspects. Furthermore, the study examines the role of physical activity,  particularly aerobic exercise, in managing premenstrual symptoms. Several  systematic reviews are cited, suggesting that regular physical activity can  effectively reduce both physical and psychological symptoms associated with PMS.  In conclusion, the management of PMS involves a multifaceted approach, with  exercises, dietary modifications, stress management, cognitive-behavioral  therapy, and medications all playing roles. Physical activity, especially  aerobic exercise, has been found to be an effective non-pharmacological therapy  for alleviating PMS symptoms and improving overall well-being. However, more  research is needed to determine the optimal type and dosage of exercise for  individual women with PMS.

Author information: (1)UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health, University College London, London, UK. (2)Centre for Reproductive Health, Institute for Regeneration and Repair,  University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.  OBJECTIVE: To explore perimenopausal women's feelings towards their periods, the  impact on their wellbeing and how we can support them. STUDY DESIGN: Participants were recruited for focus groups through social media  advertisements. In 6 online focus groups, 31 perimenopausal women aged 40-55  living in the UK were asked 5 questions relating to periods and perimenopause,  support and education. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Content analysis. RESULTS: When asked How do you feel about having a period? The participants  often related back to the stress of menarche and said their period negatively  impacted their wellbeing their whole lives. During perimenopause, their periods  had become unpredictable, heavy, and a debilitating disruption to their lives.  The women desired support at work through policy, and from family and friends.  They believed that educating girls and boys during school was the best place to  start, but that education through work and community groups was also needed.  They felt healthcare professionals should have mandatory training regarding  women's health issues and menopause. CONCLUSION: The study highlights the impact of menstrual experiences on the  wellbeing of perimenopausal women, emphasising the need for improved menstrual  education from an early age. Comprehensive menstrual education in schools  involving both genders to enable informed decision-making and improved training  for healthcare professionals are recommended. Support networks for  perimenopausal women will promote better quality of life for women as they go  through their perimenopause journey.

(2)Department of Nursing, Eulji University, Seongnam-shi, Republic of Korea.  BACKGROUND: Women undergo an array of menstrual symptoms, depending on the  menstrual cycle period. This study aimed to gain a more objective understanding  of the impact of menstruation by examining differences in menstrual symptoms,  menstrual attitude, physical stress, and psychological stress across the  menstrual cycle. METHODS: This study was conducted from Apr to Jun 2021 in the Gyeonggi Province  of Korea. Women aged ≥20 yr were divided into premenstrual (n=17), menstrual  (n=8), and postmenstrual periods (n=23). Menstrual symptoms and menstrual  attitudes were assessed using questionnaires. Quantitative  electroencephalography was used to assess the physical stress indices (left and  right), and the psychological stress indices (left and right), with brainwave  parameters quantified by frequency series power spectrum analysis. Data were  compared using the non-parametric tests. RESULTS: More menstrual symptoms were experienced in the menstrual period than  in the premenstrual period (Z=2.16, P=.031). Menstrual attitudes did not  significantly differ among menstrual periods (Z=1.20, P=.231). Physical stress  indices were high (≥10 μV) throughout the menstrual cycle and there were  significant differences among the three periods (left: χ2=4.00, P=.035, right:  χ2=5.78, P=.046). Psychological stress indices were >1 μV during the  premenstrual and menstrual periods. CONCLUSION: Women experience more severe and diverse menstrual symptoms in the  menstrual period than in other periods. Objective investigations are needed to  inform an effective approach for addressing negative menstruation-related  experiences.  Copyright © 2023 Weon et al.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the link between mental health, physical well-being, and  reproductive system pathology in females who suffered war-related concussions. METHODS: A study was conducted at the Kyiv Center of Reproductive and Perinatal  Medicine with 715 participants. The group included 457 female military personnel  with concussions (211 with post-concussive syndrome (PCS), 246 without), 208  women from occupied/deoccupied areas (103 with PCS, 105 without), and 50  civilians from safe zones. Average deployment time (mean ± standard deviation)  was 60.26 ± 42.21 months, and trauma occurred 18.81 ± 9.221 months ago. Medical  history and physical examinations were performed. RESULTS: Female soldiers with PCS had a 1.3 times higher likelihood (P < 0.015)  of experiencing longer menstrual periods. Painful menstruation was 1.47 times  more frequent (P < 0.001), and heavy periods were 1.64 times more common  (P < 0.003). Infertility duration in concussed women was 5.36 ± 0.13 years,  whereas those with PCS experienced 1.29 times longer duration  (6.02 ± 0.21 years) (P < 0.001) compared with women without PCS  (4.69 ± 0.13 years). Among concussed soldiers, 69.27% had endometrial structural  pathology, with PCS occurring 1.64 times more often (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The health decline in female veterans and active-duty personnel  extends beyond medical implications and has social significance.

STUDY QUESTION: Are there some characteristics that render individuals more  susceptible to report menstrual changes following the Coronavirus disease 2019  (COVID-19) vaccination? SUMMARY ANSWER: We found that 30% of menstruating women reported menstrual  changes following COVID-19 vaccination and several potential risk factors  including stress, vaccine concerns, severe COVID-19 infection, and immediate  vaccine symptoms were associated with these reports. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Studies suggest that COVID-19 vaccination might  temporarily prolong menstrual cycle length by less than 1 day. Specific  characteristics may trigger menstrual changes in temporal relation to the  vaccination simply by chance or render women more vigilant to potential  menstrual changes after being vaccinated. However, research investigating  potential risk factors for reporting menstrual changes following COVID-19  vaccination is limited. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A population-based Danish cohort study. Data were  collected from May 2021 to December 2021 as a part of the BiCoVac Cohort with  the aim of examining non-specific effects following COVID-19 vaccination. The  main study population included 13 648 menstruating women aged 16-65 years who  completed all surveys, received their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine during  the data collection period, and completed questions related to their menstrual  cycle. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Potential risk factors included 14  biological, physical, or psychological measures. Information on most potential  risk factors was self-reported and collected before the participants' first  COVID-19 vaccination. Information about any menstrual change following COVID-19  vaccination was self-reported at the end of the data collection period. Logistic  regression analyses were used to estimate crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs)  with 95% CIs for the association between each potential risk factor and  reporting menstrual changes following COVID-19 vaccination. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Any menstrual change following COVID-19  vaccination was reported by 30% of menstruating women. Most of the potential  risk factors were associated with reports of menstrual changes following  COVID-19 vaccination. In particular, higher odds were found among women who  reported ≥5 immediate vaccine symptoms; OR 1.67 [1.50-1.86], had had a prior  severe COVID-19 infection; OR 2.17 [1.40-3.35], had a high-stress level at  baseline; OR 1.67 [1.32-2.10], or were concerned about COVID-19 vaccines prior  to vaccination; OR 1.92 [1.50-2.45]. Lower odds were found among women with  regular menstrual cycles using hormonal contraception; OR 0.71 [0.65-0.78]. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: We were unable to address the causal effect of  COVID-19 vaccination on the reported menstrual changes, as information about  menstrual changes was not available among non-vaccinated women. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The study identified several potential risk  factors for reporting menstrual changes following COVID-19 vaccination. Further  studies are needed to establish causal associations and the clinical impact of  self-reported menstrual changes.

Ovarian dysfunction increases risk for chronic diseases of aging including  cardiovascular disease, depression, cognitive impairment, as well as bone and  muscle loss which promote frailty. Psychosocial stress can disrupt ovarian  function, and recent observations suggest that consumption of a Western Diet may  also. Determination of causal relationships among diet, psychosocial stress, and  ovarian physiology is difficult in humans. Long-tailed (a.k.a. cynomolgus)  macaques (Macaca fascicularis) are an excellent translational model for the  study of diet and psychosocial effects on ovarian physiology and aging-related  processes. They have 28-day menstrual cycles with hormonal fluctuations like  those of women, and similar physiologic responses to alterations and/or  cessation of cyclicity. We examined ovarian function in 38 middle-aged socially  housed females fed either a Western or Mediterranean diet for 31 months (≈ a  9-year period for humans). During the last year, we examined cycle length and  peak progesterone per cycle using blood sampling (3/week) and vaginal swabbing  for menses (6/week). Repeated measures analysis revealed a circannual pattern  consistent with increased menstrual cycle disturbance during the late Summer and  early Fall (F(11,348)= 4.05 p < 0.001). In addition, both Western diet  (F(1,34)= 3.99; p = 0.05) and the stress of low social status (F(1,34)= 3.99;  p = 0.04) reduced mean progesterone levels. Thus, on average, subordinates in  the Western group had the lowest average progesterone levels (10.02 ng/pl).  Compared to Western diets, Mediterranean diets exhibited protective effects via  menstrual cycle regularity. For dominant monkeys, consuming Mediterranean diets  resulted in significantly greater likelihood of having regular menstrual cycles.  Mediterranean diets also protected individuals from shorter than normal  menstrual cycles. The relationships between diet and menstrual regularity were  partially mediated by both adrenal reactivity and social isolation. This study  demonstrates the additive negative effects of poor diet and psychosocial stress  on ovarian physiology in mid-life and lays the groundwork for future  investigations to uncover their impact on metabolic signatures of accelerated  aging. The results also suggest that - compared to Western-style diets - a  Mediterranean diet may exert a protective influence against ovarian dysfunction  and its pathologic sequelae.

There is growing recognition of the important role menstrual health plays in  achieving health, education, and gender equity. Yet, stigmatisation and taboo  remain present and negative emotions like fear and shame dominate the narrative  when speaking about periods. This paper analyses how formal and informal  menstrual education is received in Spain, to understand the role of menstrual  health literacy in the way menstruation is experienced, and to identify what  information would be useful to integrate into formal menstrual education. An  online survey with more than 4000 participants (aged between 14 and 80, both  people who will/do/have previously menstruate/d and those who do not menstruate)  was conducted. Data was gathered using the digital platform Typeform,  descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were performed with SPSS  software and qualitative data was thematically analysed using Nvivo. Many  participants declared not having received sufficient information on menstruation  prior to menarche, particularly about how to physically manage it. Furthermore,  negative emotions like shame, worry, and fear were recurrently reported to  describe menarche; this has not changed between generations. Interestingly, we  saw an increase in stress and sadness with an increase in perceived knowledge of  the reproductive role of menstruation. We did observe a reduction in negative  emotions when people who menstruate perceived they had sufficient information on  how to manage their first bleeding. It is recommended that menstrual education  beyond reproductive biology, particularly including how to physically manage  periods, is integrated into school curricula. Menstrual education of everyone -  including those who do not menstruate-can improve how periods are experienced in  Spain.  © 2023. The Author(s).

Author information: (1)Independent Researcher, New Delhi, India. (2)Division of Biochemistry, Department of Basic Medical Sciences, Manipal  Academy of Higher Education, Manipal, India.  Menstruation is a naturally occurring phenomenon; however, millions of  adolescent girls and women, as well as nonbinary persons who bleed every month,  are deprived of menstruating safely and respectfully. Those belonging to  marginalized sections face the brunt of lack of access to water, sanitation, and  hygiene facilities; affordable menstrual supplies; and inequitable distribution  of menstrual health education and are victims of period poverty. Their  preexisting suffering was further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which  negatively affected the mental health of those menstruating. Adolescent girls  and women in communities found it persistently challenging to access and afford  menstrual products while deprived of menstrual hygiene education. These put them  under immense stress and elevated financial liability, predisposing them to  period poverty. Interventions addressing period poverty rely on mustering  collective community voices and deploying adequate policy tools. All the efforts  and solutions must provide social and financial protection nets and  psychological aid through mental health support groups. It is core to drive  menstrual health equity for all menstruators, irrespective of who they are, what  they do, and where they live.  © 2023 Rohatgi and Dash.

Professional athletes are often exposed to high training loads that may lead to  overfatigue, overreaching and overtraining that might have a detrimental effects  on vascular health. We determined the effects of high training stress on  endothelial function assessed by the flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and markers of  glycocalyx shedding. Vascular examination as well as broad biochemical, hormonal  and cardiometabolic evaluation of sprint and middle-distance female runners were  performed after 2 months of preparatory training period and compared to  age-matched control group of women. Female athletes presented with significantly  reduced FMD (p < 0.01) and higher basal serum concentrations of hyaluronan (HA)  and syndecan-1 (SDC-1) (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively), that was  accompanied by significantly lower basal serum testosterone (T) and free  testosterone (fT) concentrations (p < 0.05) and higher cortisol (C)  concentration (p < 0.05). It resulted in significantly lower T/C and fT/C ratios  in athletes when compared to controls (p < 0.01). Moreover, fT/C ratio were  significantly positively correlated to FMD and negatively to HA concentrations  in all studied women. Accordingly, the training load was significantly  negatively correlated with T/C, fT/C and FMD and positively with the  concentrations of HA and SDC-1. We concluded that young female track and field  athletes subjected to physical training developed impairment of endothelial  function that was associated with anabolic-catabolic hormone balance  disturbances. Given that training-induced impairment of endothelial function may  have a detrimental effects on vascular health, endothelial status should be  regularly monitored in the time-course of training process to minimalize  vascular health-risk in athletes.  © 2023.

PURPOSE: The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has imposed a  heavy burden on medical systems. In addition to the respiratory system, the  virus also causes injuries to other organs and systems such as the gastroenteric  system, kidneys, and reproductive system. Female reproductive health requires  more attention in this context. METHODS: We have performed a thorough review of the relevant literature that  addresses the impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination on the  female reproductive system. RESULTS: Most evidence shows that SARS-CoV-2 does not infect the female  reproductive system. However, the virus may indirectly influence sex hormone  concentrations through inflammation associated with cytokine storms and nervous  system damage. Menstrual disorders in women infected with SARS-CoV-2 may be  caused by down-regulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, abnormal hormone  levels, medications, and stress. There is no significant difference in ovarian  follicle quality and in vitro fertilization parameters between the pre- and  post-COVID-19 vaccination groups. In addition, most symptoms due to side effects  of vaccination could recover within a short period of time. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection affects female reproductive system function  through multiple mechanisms. It is recommended that women of childbearing age be  vaccinated with COVID-19 vaccine.  © 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany,  part of Springer Nature.

Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a metabolic, reproductive, and  psychological complex series of disorders that impacts a woman throughout her  lifespan. PCOS is a disorder of hormonal imbalance occurring in women of  reproductive age. This disorder is characterized by high levels of male  androgens like testosterone. This can lead to symptoms like irregular periods,  amenorrhea (absence of menstruation), anovulation (absence of ovulation),  hirsutism, acne, and obesity. PCOS also causes metabolic impairment. Multiple  peripherally arranged immature follicles of about 2-5mm in diameter are present  in the ovary. These follicles do not mature due to hormonal imbalances leading  to an irregular menstrual cycle. PCOS is a metabolic, reproductive, and  psychological complex series of disorders that impacts a woman throughout her  lifespan. Polycystic ovarian syndrome is not a fatal or life-threatening  disorder as its main complication is infertility. PCOS can be a root cause  of serious medical conditions like obesity, hypertension, type-2 diabetes  mellitus due to insulin resistance, endometrial cancers, ovarian cancer, etc.  Stress may cause the hormone levels in the pituitary to fluctuate. Since the  menstrual cycle is hormone-based, there are apparent irregularities.  Copyright © 2023, Adone et al.

The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in heightened stress for many individuals, with  women reporting more stress than men. Although a large body of evidence has  demonstrated that stress, in general, can impact the menstrual cycle, it is not  yet clear if COVID-specific stress would impact women's menstrual health. The  current study explored the relationship between COVID-related stress and  distress and menstrual variables (menstrual pain, number and severity of  menstrual symptoms, and menstrual pain interference) in a sample of  reproductive-age adult women. Seven-hundred fifteen women completed the initial  survey and were re-contacted to complete the same survey three months later. Of  those recontacted, 223 completed the follow-up survey. Results indicated that  COVID-related stress and distress was associated with higher levels of menstrual  pain, more frequent and more severe menstrual symptoms, and greater menstrual  pain interference, even after accounting for age, hormonal use, bodily pain, and  pain catastrophizing. Our findings suggest that women experience unique  vulnerabilities that directly impact their health and functioning, and both  research and clinical care should address these symptoms through careful  assessment and treatment of menstrual pain and symptoms, particularly during and  after periods of high stress and distress.

We conducted literature searches of PubMed and Ichushi-Web and  used the Jonna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist to assess the  quality. Of the 77 studies included in the meta-analysis, significant odds  ratios (ORs) were obtained for eight factors associated with primary  dysmenorrhea (PD): age ≥ 20 years (OR: 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI]:  1.04−1.34), body mass index (BMI) < 18.5 kg/m2 (OR: 1.51; 95% CI: 1.01−2.26),  longer menstrual periods (OR: 0.16; 95% CI: 0.04−0.28), irregular menstrual  cycle (OR: 1.28; 95% CI: 1.13−1.45), family history of PD (OR: 3.80; 95% CI:  2.18−6.61), stress (OR: 1.88; 95% CI: 1.30−2.72), sleeping hours < 7 h (OR:  1.19; 95% CI: 1.04−1.35), and bedtime after 23:01 (OR: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.16−1.45).  Two factors were associated with severity of PD (moderate vs. severe): BMI <  18.5 kg/m2 (OR: 1.89; 95% CI: 1.01−3.54) and smoking (OR: 1.94; 95% CI:  1.08−3.47). PD severity (mild vs. severe) and prevalence of premenstrual  syndrome were associated with BMI < 18.5 kg/m2 (OR: 1.91; 95% CI: 1.04−3.50) and  smoking (OR: 1.86; 95% CI: 1.31−2.66), respectively.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate how stress related to the coronavirus disease 2019  (COVID-19) pandemic has affected women's menstrual cycles. We hypothesized that  women with high levels of COVID-19-related stress would have more menstrual  changes compared with those with lower levels of stress. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional study design, we recruited a representative  sample of U.S. adult women of reproductive age (18-45 years) using nonhormonal  birth control to participate in an online REDCap (Research Electronic Data  Capture, Vanderbilt University) survey. COVID-19-related stress was assessed  with the PSS-10-C (COVID-19 Pandemic-related Perceived Stress Scale) and  dichotomized as low stress (scores lower than 25) and high stress (scores 25 or  higher). Self-reported menstrual outcomes were identified as changes in cycle  length, duration, or flow and increased frequency of spotting between cycles. We  used χ 2 and Fisher exact tests to compare differences in outcome between the  two stress groups and logistic regression models for effect estimates. RESULTS: A total of 354 women of reproductive age across the United States  completed both the menstrual and COVID-19-related stress components of our  survey. More than half of these women reported at least one change in their  menstrual cycles since the start of the pandemic (n=191), and 10.5% reported  high COVID-19-related stress (n=37). Compared with those with low  COVID-19-related stress, a greater proportion of women with high  COVID-19-related stress reported changes in cycle length (shorter or longer; P  =.008), changes in period duration (shorter or longer; P <.001), heavier  menstrual flow ( P =.035), and increased frequency of spotting between cycles (  P =.006) compared with prepandemic times. After adjusting for age, smoking  history, obesity, education, and mental health history, high COVID-19-related  stress was associated with increased odds of changes in menstrual cycle length  (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.32; 95% CI 1.12-4.85), duration (aOR 2.38; 95% CI  1.14-4.98), and spotting (aOR 2.32; 95% CI 1.03-5.22). Our data also  demonstrated a nonsignificant trend of heavier menstrual flow among women with  high COVID-19-related stress (aOR 1.61; 95% CI 0.77-3.34). CONCLUSION: High COVID-19-related stress is associated with significant changes  in menstrual cycle length, alterations in period duration, and increased  intermenstrual spotting as compared with before the pandemic. Given that  menstrual health is frequently an indicator of women's overall well-being,  clinicians, researchers, and public health officials must consider the  association between COVID-19-related stress and menstrual disturbances.

BACKGROUND: The menstrual cycle in women is the main indicator of their  reproductive health which is affected by the ongoing coronavirus disease  2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This review aims to summarize the effects of the  COVID-19 infection and the global pandemic on the menstrual health of women. METHODS: The literature search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane library, and  Google Scholar using keywords ""COVID-19,"" ""Menstrual Cycle,"" ""Menstrual Cycle  Irregularities,"" ""Amenorrhea,"" ""Polymenorrhea,"" and ""Dysmenorrhea."" The articles  were selected according to the following inclusion criteria: (i) cross-sectional  studies, (ii) cohort studies, (iii) surveys, and (iv) other observational  studies observing the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 pandemic on  menstrual health of women. Exclusion criteria included: case reports, gray  literature, and website articles regarding menstrual health. RESULTS: A total of 30,510 articles were shortlisted after a comprehensive  search. Sixteen articles were included out of which 13 studies investigated the  effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the menstrual cycle while 3 evaluated the  possible effects of COVID-19 infection on the menstrual health of women.  Menstrual disorders or irregularities were a more common finding during the  pandemic as compared to before (p = 0.008). Women affected by pandemic-related  stress were more prone to changes in the duration of their menses (p = 0.0008),  reported heavier bleeding (p = 0.028), and increased incidence of painful  periods (p < 0.0001). COVID-19 infected women also reported changes in their  menstrual cycle including irregular menstruation, increased symptoms of  premenstrual syndrome, and infrequent menstruation. CONCLUSIONS: Women suffering from COVID-19 infection or pandemic-associated  stress and anxiety were more likely to experience irregular menstruation,  dysmenorrhea, amenorrhea, and other menstrual abnormalities compared to those  who were less exposed.  © 2022 The Authors.

The pandemic has transformed the social and economic certainties of people's  lives imposing stay-at-home necessities which began in mid-March 2020. This  cross-sectional observational study was performed to study the impact of  COVID-19 on the reproductive and mental health of women before and after the  pandemic. A digital survey form of 50 questions was developed using the Google  platform andshared over 4 weeks in August 2021. Paired t-test was used to  compare the variables before and after the COVID-19. Of the 450 respondents,  443(98.44%) completed the questionnaire. There was a significant difference in  the average duration of menstruation and the proportion of women with a cycle  length of 35-45 days increased from 5 to 8% of women after the pandemic. Painful  periods (28.5 to 59.5%, p = .002) and weight increased (39.2%, p < .001) after  the pandemic. Stress also increased after the pandemic (p < .001). The pandemic  has significantly impacted the reproductive and mental health of women. The  long-term health significances of this are yet to be determined.Impact  StatementWhat is already known on this subject? The pandemic has transformed the  social and economic certainties of people's lives, mainly women. Women's health  significantly mental health is affected by the lack of adequate domestic and  emotional support which may further consequences like the risk of anxiety and  depression.What do the results of this study add? Our study shows the effect of  COVID-19 on women's reproductive and mental health before and after the  pandemic. Inadvertent forfeits women's health and well-being and instabilities  in reproductive function as raised pressure causes irregularities in the  menstrual cycle.What are the implications of these findings for clinical  practice and/or further research? Women have suffered from significant mental  and reproductive problems during the first and second waves of the COVID-19  pandemic. But, the long-term effects of these are not unknown. Upcoming work  should comprise study throughout the pandemic and the long-term impact on  women's health.  DOI: 10.1080/01443615.2022.2125292 PMID: 36151782 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

BACKGROUND: Menstrual irregularity is defined as any differences in the  frequency, irregularity of onset, duration of flow, or volume of blood from the  regular menstrual cycle. It is an important medical issue that many medical  students suffer from. The study aimed to determine the menstrual cycle  abnormalities women experienced during exams and to investigate the most common  types of irregularities among female medical students at King Abdulaziz  University in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among female medical students  between September and October 2021 at King Abdulaziz University in Jeddah, Saudi  Arabia. For this study, the estimated sample size (n = 450) was derived from the  online Raosoft sample size calculator. Thus, 450 female medical students from  second to sixth year were selected through stratified random sampling. A  validated online questionnaire collected data about demographics, menstrual  irregularities during exams, type of irregularities, menstrual history, family  history of menstrual irregularities, premenstrual symptoms, medication use,  medical and family consultations, and absenteeism. The chi-squared test (χ2) was  used to analyze the associations between variables. RESULTS: A total of 48.2% of participants had menstrual irregularities during  exams. The most common irregularity was dysmenorrhea (70.9%), followed by a  lengthened cycle (45.6%), and heavy bleeding (41.9%). A total of 93% of medical  students suffered from premenstrual symptoms and 60.4% used medication such as  herbal medication and home remedies to relieve menstrual irregularities, and  12.1% of the students missed classes due to menstrual irregularities. A  non-significant relationship was found between menstrual irregularities during  exams and students' demographics, academic year, and age at menarche, while  oligomenorrhea, a heavier than normal bleed, a longer than normal cycle, and  missing classes due to menstrual irregularities were significantly higher among  single students as opposed to married students. CONCLUSION: The results showed that female medical students have a significant  frequency of menstruation abnormalities during exams period. Colleges should  raise awareness among medical students about coping with examination stress and  seeking medical care for menstrual abnormalities.  © 2022. The Author(s).

BACKGROUND: A number of previous studies have explored international students'  adaptation process with regards to language, lifestyle, food, and environment.  However, there have yet been no studies conducted to address the menstrual  symptoms challenges faced by international female students during the  acculturation period. Thus, this study aims to describe the prevalence of  menstrual symptoms change and to explore the influencing factors among  international female students studying in China during the acculturation period. METHODS: An online cross sectional study was conducted among international  female students studying in China during the acculturation period (defined as  the first six months of living in the host country) in Hunan Province of China  from March 2019 to July 2019. Menstrual symptoms questionnaire, sociocultural  adaptation scale, China higher education student satisfaction scale, perceived  stress scale, and Pittsburgh sleep quality index were used for data collection.  Descriptive analysis, ANOVA, paired t-test, Pearson correlation, and  multivariate linear regressions were used to analyze the data using SPSS 21.0  software. RESULTS: Three hundred and forty-five (97.18%, 345/355) female students from 45  countries fully completed the questionnaire. The mean age of the participants  was (26.59 ± 6.439) years. In total, 18.49% of participants had encountered  menstrual symptoms change. There were significant differences in the menstrual  symptoms score between before arrival and evaluation during the first six months  of living in China (t = - 11.700, p = 0.000). The main menstrual symptoms change  included cramps (17.68%), irritation (14.78%), abdominal pain (12.46%), fatigue  (12.46%), and headaches (9.85%). Cultural adaptation level (β = 0.198, 95% CI:  0.934, 2.995), sleep quality (β = 0.166, 95% CI: 0.112, 0.496), perceived stress  (β = 0.193, 95% CI: 0.123, 0.410), time spent in the host environment,  (β = - 0.270, 95% CI: - 3.200, - 1.444) and experience of visiting foreign  countries (β = 0.184, 95% CI: 1.134, 4.125) were significantly correlated with  menstrual symptoms change. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of menstrual symptoms change among international  female students should not be overlooked when considering menstrual health in  this population. Poorer cultural adaptation, poorer sleep quality, higher  stress, and lack of overseas living experiences significantly influence the  menstrual symptoms of international female students studying in China.  © 2022.

Physical activity has many health-related benefits, including prevention and  management of chronic disease, weight management, and improved mental health.  Active girls and women of all ages and abilities are at risk of relative energy  deficiency in sport, a syndrome encompassing low energy availability, menstrual  irregularities, and disordered bone metabolism. Presence of amenorrhea or  oligomenorrhea may suggest reduced energy availability. Active females are at  risk of overuse injuries, including patellofemoral pain syndrome, iliotibial  band syndrome, and stress fractures; treatment usually includes activity  modification, a period of rest, and physical therapy. Active females are also at  risk of acute injuries, including concussion and anterior cruciate ligament  injuries. Pregnant patients without contraindications who were physically active  before pregnancy can continue these activities, and those who were not  previously active may gradually increase their activity level to a goal of 150  minutes per week. Moderate exercise during pregnancy reduces the risk of  gestational diabetes mellitus, preeclampsia, and cesarean delivery. Postpartum  exercise focused on core and pelvic floor strengthening can improve pelvic floor  dysfunction. Supervised exercise programs focused on strength and balance have  been consistently shown to reduce the risk of falls and injurious falls in older  women.  PMID: 35839365 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Unmet need and harm from poor menstrual health in  low-and- middle-income countries have been documented, but with little empirical  research undertaken in high income countries. Continuing austerity in the UK  suggests menstruators are likely more vulnerable to 'period poverty' than  previously, with the COVID-19 pandemic assumed to exacerbate the situation. AIM: To explore the menstrual experiences and perceptions of women in the UK who  are living under circumstances of deprivation, alongside views of staff working  in organisations supporting these women, to understand whether women's menstrual  needs are met. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted in an inner-city in NW England. Three  focus group discussions and 14 in-depth interviews were conducted across three  study sites supporting impoverished women. Data was analysed thematically. RESULTS: Themes were: reflections on menstruation; affordability of products;  access to public facilities; organisational support; potential solutions. Many  women perceived menstruation as a burden in three aspects: physical discomfort  and pain; psychological anxiety; and shame and stigma. Managing menstruation was  difficult due to cost relative to low incomes, with food, heating and lighting  prioritised, leaving women improvising with materials or wearing products for  longer than desired. Most suggested that products should be free, often  remarking if men required similar items this would happen. Most women were  unaware supporting organisations provided free products. Staff felt the small  range of products offered did not meet client needs and were ill-prepared to  have conversations on products and clients' menstrual needs. CONCLUSION: Impoverished women lack the necessary resources to manage their  menses well which negatively impacts their health and brings stress,  embarrassment, and shame. Support, including access to free products, is needed  at both local and national level to help impoverished women manage their  menstrual hygiene.

(4)Department of Biostatistics, AIIMS, New Delhi, India.  BACKGROUND: Cancellation of any scheduled surgery is a significant drain on  health resources and potentially stressful for patients. It is frequent in  menstruating women who are scheduled to undergo open heart surgery (OHS), based  on the widespread belief that it increases surgical and menstrual blood loss. AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate blood loss in women undergoing OHS  during menstruation. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A prospective, matched case-control study which included  sixty women of reproductive age group undergoing OHS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The surgical blood loss was compared between women who  were menstruating (group-M; n = 25) and their matched controls, i.e., women who  were not menstruating (group-NM; n = 25) at the time of OHS. Of the women in  group M, the menstrual blood loss during preoperative (subgroup-P) and  perioperative period (subgroup-PO) was compared to determine the effect of OHS  on menstrual blood loss. RESULTS: The surgical blood loss was comparable among women in both groups  irrespective of ongoing menstruation (gr-M = 245.6 ± 120.1 ml vs gr-NM = 243.6 ±  129.9 ml, P value = 0.83). The menstrual blood loss was comparable between  preoperative and perioperative period in terms of total menstrual blood loss  (gr-P = 36.8 ± 4.8 ml vs gr-PO = 37.7 ± 5.0 ml, P value = 0.08) and duration of  menstruation (gr-P = 4.2 ± 0.6 days vs gr-PO = 4.4 ± 0.6 days, P value = 0.10). CONCLUSION: Neither the surgical blood loss nor the menstrual blood loss is  increased in women undergoing OHS during menstruation.

Long JL(1), Haver J(1), Mendoza P(1), Vargas Kotasek SM(2).  Author information: (1)Department of Education and Child Protection, Save the Children, Washington,  DC, United States. (2)Programs, Save the Children, Mexico City, Mexico.  Improving the menstrual health literacy of girls and boys is a key strategy  within a holistic framework of Save the Children's school health and  comprehensive sexuality education programming. As menstrual health is an  emerging area of study and programming, Save the Children continues to learn and  adjust its interventions using program evaluations and rigorous monitoring. This  paper will examine program-monitoring data from three cohorts, representing 47  public schools in Mexico City, Puebla, and Mérida, Mexico. The study focuses on  female students in 5th and 6th grade who participated in We See Equal, a  school-based program centered on gender equality and puberty education, between  September 2018 and December 2019. This study used a cross-sectional quantitative  cohort approach to document changes in girls' experiences and perceptions around  managing menstruation in school. The analysis compares girls' knowledge and  experiences before and after participation in We See Equal to understand how  knowledge changes over the program and how those changes may contribute to  menstruation-related school engagement, stress, and self-efficacy (MENSES)  outcomes. Multivariate regression models explored relationships between MENSES  outcomes, knowledge and socioeconomic status (SES). Overall, results show that  the more knowledge girls acquired, the higher their self-efficacy score and the  lower their stress score, however, certain MHH knowledge was more predictive of  MENSES outcomes and varied by SES. Among girls from lower SES, we observed  significant relationships between knowing what their period was prior to  menarche and the three MENSES outcomes. Decreases in menstruation-related stress  were driven by items related to the practical knowledge of how to dispose of  sanitary pads and reduced feelings of nervousness on days they had their period  at school. Increases in self-efficacy were primarily driven by girls' confidence  in their ability to track their period from month to month, feelings that they  could still do well on an exam if they had their period at school, and security  that they could ask a friend to lend them a pad if they needed one. Implications  for future menstrual health literacy programming and targeting populations for  menstrual health education, as well as priorities for future research will be  discussed.

(5)State Key Laboratory of Media Convergence Production Technology and Systems,  Beijing, China.  The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is activated by stress and is closely related  to the female menstrual cycle. Women with premenstrual syndrome (PMS) have an  imbalanced ANS response in their premenstrual period. However, no studies have  explored the reasons for the differences in ANS response among women. In this  study, we investigated how the female menstrual attitude and acute social stress  influence the ANS response in women with PMS. First, 277 women [24.35 ± 2.1]  were selected to measure the mediating role of women's menstrual attitude  between PMS severity and perceived ANS response. Second, participants' (50 women  [23.23 ± 1.25] with and 46 women [22.92 ± 2.00] without PMS) heart rate (HR) and  HR variability (HRV; reflecting the functioning of ANS) under social stress were  measured during various menstrual cycle phases. The results indicated that  menstrual attitude (bothersome and predictable) had mediating effects between  the degree of PMS and perceived ANS response; when undergoing a high cognitive  load (e.g. mental-arithmetic) task, the ANS of the PMS group demonstrated  hypo-arousal and delayed recovery in the late luteal phase; Therefore, menstrual  attitude could influence female perceived ANS response, which may be a risk  factor for PMS. When women with PMS experience high-strength cognitive pressure  in the premenstrual period, their ANS showed hypo-arousal and delayed recovery,  which may be another risk factor for PMS.  Plain Language Summary: LAY SUMMARYThis study revealed that the attitude to  menstruation (bothersome and predictable) could affect the women’s autonomic  nervous system (ANS) response, and this may be a risk factor of premenstrual  syndrome (PMS). Meanwhile, when women with PMS experience high-strength  cognitive social pressure, their ANS showed hypo-arousal and delayed recovery.  This imbalanced ANS reaction may result in their inability to cope with the  stressful stimuli and emotional experiences, which may be another risk factor  for PMS.

During their lifespan, many women are exposed to pain in the pelvis in relation  to menstruation and pregnancy. Such pelvic pain is often considered normal and  inherently linked to being a woman, which in turn leads to insufficiently  offered treatment for treatable aspects related to their pain experience.  Nonetheless, severe dysmenorrhea (pain during menstruation) as seen in  endometriosis and pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain, have a high impact on  daily activities, school attendance and work ability. In the context of any type  of chronic pain, accumulating evidence shows that an unhealthy lifestyle is  associated with pain development and pain severity. Furthermore, unhealthy  lifestyle habits are a suggested perpetuating factor of chronic pain. This is of  specific relevance during lifespan, since a low physical activity level, poor  sleep, or periods of (di)stress are all common in challenging periods of women's  lives (e.g., during menstruation, during pregnancy, in the postpartum period).  This state-of-the-art paper aims to review the role of lifestyle factors on pain  in the pelvis, and the added value of a lifestyle intervention on pain in women  with pelvic pain. Based on the current evidence, the benefits of physical  activity and exercise for women with pain in the pelvis are supported to some  extent. The available evidence on lifestyle factors such as sleep, (di)stress,  diet, and tobacco/alcohol use is, however, inconclusive. Very few studies are  available, and the studies which are available are of general low quality. Since  the role of lifestyle on the development and maintenance of pain in the pelvis,  and the value of lifestyle interventions for women with pain in the pelvis are  currently poorly studied, a research agenda is presented. There are a number of  rationales to study the effect of promoting a healthy lifestyle (early) in a  woman's life with regard to the prevention and management of pain in the pelvis.  Indeed, lifestyle interventions might have, amongst others, anti-inflammatory,  stress-reducing and/or sleep-improving effects, which might positively affect  the experience of pain. Research to disentangle the relationship between  lifestyle factors, such as physical activity level, sleep, diet, smoking, and  psychological distress, and the experience of pain in the pelvis is, therefore,  needed. Studies which address the development of management strategies for  adapting lifestyles that are specifically tailored to women with pain in the  pelvis, and as such take hormonal status, life events and context, into account,  are required. Towards clinicians, we suggest making use of the window of  opportunity to prevent a potential transition from localized or periodic pain in  the pelvis (e.g., dysmenorrhea or pain during pregnancy and after delivery)  towards persistent chronic pain, by promoting a healthy lifestyle and applying  appropriate pain management.

The female athlete triad: review of current literature.  Maya J(1), Misra M.  Author information: (1)Division of Pediatric Endocrinology, Massachusetts General Hospital and  Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Adolescence and young adulthood are a critical period in the  life of women for optimizing long-term bone health. Young athletes lead a  demanding lifestyle with increased dietary requirements to meet the robust  demands of energy expenditure to maintain a state of energy balance. During a  time of fast paced changes and unpredictable societal demands on young athletes,  it is important to review the severe consequences of energy deficiency and  options for adequate management. RECENT FINDINGS: This review focuses on hormonal adaptations that occur in  energy deficient female athletes that lead to menstrual irregularities and  impaired bone health, increasing the risk for stress and other fractures. We  also describe management strategies to mitigate the consequences of limited  energy availability on bone and other outcomes. SUMMARY: These strategies should help guide the management of young female  athletes to prevent irreversible changes to their bone health. Identifying  current knowledge should help increase awareness among medical providers, which  can then be communicated to the sports community, parents, and athletes.

RESEARCH QUESTION: Menstruation is a physiological event often associated with  subjective distress. Is there a tool that assesses and objectively evaluates the  global distress experienced by women during their period? DESIGN: An observational cross-sectional study conducted between June 2019 and  May 2020 at Careggi University Hospital, Florence, Italy. A new questionnaire,  The Menstrual Distress Questionnaire (MEDI-Q), was developed and administered to  a group of healthy women (n = 418) of fertile age (18-50 years), without known  uterine, psychiatric disorders, or both. The MEDI-Q investigated 25 items,  covering the following areas: pain, discomfort, psychic or cognitive changes,  gastrointestinal symptoms and changes in physiological functions. MEDI-Q Total  Score and the three sub-scales, Menstrual Symptoms (MS), Menstrual Symptoms  Distress (MSD) and Menstrual Specificity Index (MESI) were evaluated. The  validation of MEDI-Q was achieved by testing test-retest reliability and  internal consistency, convergent and concurrent validity. RESULTS: The MEDI-Q produced reliable results with good internal consistency,  convergent and concurrent validity. MEDI-Q Total Score, MS and MSD all  positively correlated with general psychopathology and premenstrual symptoms. A  receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to determine the cut-off  value of 20 (inclusive) and to identify the women with clinically relevant  menstrual distress (area under the curve 0.90, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.93; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: MEDI-Q is a new tool for evaluating menstruation-related distress,  and provides a representative score of stress perception. MEDI-Q may be added to  routine women's healthcare to help identify and adequately monitor  menstruation-related disorders, and their effect on wellbeing, promptly.

Endometriosis is a chronic, estrogen-dependent gynecologic disorder that affects  reproductive-aged women and to a lesser extent, post-menopausal women on hormone  therapy. The condition is associated with systemic and local immune  dysfunctions. While its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood,  endometriosis has a genetic component and propensity for the disease is subject  to environmental, nutritional, and lifestyle influences. Previously, we showed  that high-fat diet (HFD) increased ectopic lesion numbers, concurrent with  systemic and peritoneal changes in inflammatory and oxidative stress status, in  immunocompetent recipient mice ip administered with endometrial fragments null  for Krüppel-like factor 9 gene. Herein, we determined whether HFD modifies  lesion parameters, when recipient peritoneal environment is challenged with  ectopic wild-type (WT) endometrial fragments, the latter simulating retrograde  menstruation common in women during the menstrual period. WT  endometrium-recipient mice fed HFD (45% kcal from fat) showed reduced lesion  incidence, numbers, and volumes, in the absence of changes in systemic ovarian  steroid hormone and insulin levels, relative to those fed the control diet (CD,  17% kcal from fat). Lesions from HFD- and CD-fed recipients demonstrated  comparable gene expression for steroid hormone receptors (Esr and Pgr) and  cytokines (Il-6, Il-8, and CxCL4) and similar levels of DNA oxidative  biomarkers. HFD moderately altered serum (3-nitrotyrosine and  methionine/homocysteine) and peritoneal (reduced glutathione/oxidized  glutathione) pro-oxidative status but had no effect on peritoneal inflammatory  (tumor necrosis factor α and tumor necrosis factor receptor 1) mediators.  Results indicate that lesion genotype modifies dietary effects on disease  establishment and/or progression and if translated, could be important for  provision of nutritional guidelines to women with predisposition to, or affected  by endometriosis.

Throughout the developing world, girls face hardships surrounding menstruation,  often resulting in poor emotional wellbeing and missing school. Providing ways  to keep girls in school will increase their educational and earning potentials,  which will ultimately trickle down to improving the economic standing of nations  in the next generation. Informed by the Transactional Model of Stress and  Coping, this work evaluates the roles that cultural and school environments play  in appraisals of menstruation as a major life stressor for adolescent females  and the impacts of emotional stress on missing school. Using primary survey data  from schools in Nepal, robust results are found to support the theoretical  framework based on conditional mixed-process (CMP) estimation with fixed  effects, utilizing multiple index building techniques. Strong cultural norms  during menstruation appear to increase the probability of girls self-reporting  emotional stress, while the presence of hygiene supporting infrastructure at  schools reduces this outcome. Furthermore, there is strong support for the  finding that the presence of emotional stress during menstruation increases the  likelihood of not only missing school but also for an extended period of time.  Our findings motivate increasing government policies to provide stronger hygiene  infrastructure in schools to improve successful coping skills and attendance  rates.

Female menstrual health and its relationship with sleep is an understudied  subject. The aim of this investigation was to determine the association between  the two in a community sample. Data were obtained from n = 579 menstruating  females who participated in the Sleep and Health Activity, Diet, Environment,  and Socialization (SHADES) study, a community-based sample of adults aged 22-60  years. Participants were asked, ""How regular is your period?"", with response  choices of ""very regular"", ""mostly regular"", ""fairly regular"" and ""not regular"".  They were also asked, ""How much bleeding do you usually experience during your  period?"" Response choices were: ""very heavy"", ""heavy"", ""medium"", ""light"" or  ""very light"". These were evaluated as ordinal outcomes. Sleep-related predictors  included sleep duration (in hr; ≤ 6 [short], 7-9 [normal] and ≥ 9 [long]),  Insomnia Severity Index score, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score, Epworth  Sleepiness Scale score and Fatigue Severity Scale score. Covariates included  age, education, income, race/ethnicity and body mass index. Short sleep duration  was associated with heavier bleeding (odds ratio = 1.46, p = 0.026) and greater  cycle irregularity (odds ratio = 1.44, p = 0.031) as compared with normal sleep.  Higher Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score was associated with greater cycle  irregularity (odds ratio = 1.05, p = 0.022). Higher Fatigue Severity Scale score  was associated with heavier bleeding (odds ratio = 1.02, p = 0.003) and greater  cycle irregularity (odds ratio = 1.02, p = 0.008). Long sleep, Insomnia Severity  Index and Epworth Sleepiness Scale were not associated with either outcome.  These results demonstrate an association between short sleep duration, poor  sleep quality, fatigue, stress and depression with heavier bleeding and  menstrual cycle irregularity, highlighting the need for further studies to  improve treatment options.  © 2021 European Sleep Research Society.

Women who  are having menstruation troubles should get their mental health checked by  healthcare specialists. In young women, a menstrual-related condition has  serious health implications. Young females who have menstrual issues miss job  and school, and their behavioural and mental development suffers as a result.  Depression and anxiety have an impact on women's menstrual periods in adults.  Symptoms like as cramps, tiredness, backache, swelling abdomen, and painful  breasts have also been described in women with menstrual misery. Menstrual  distress has been shown to impair women's daily activities, as well as their  reproductive and psychological health, according to research. Menstrual periods  are frequently accompanied by a variety of unpleasant symptoms, such as  premenstrual syndrome, which includes symptoms such as mild cramping and  exhaustion. The severity of these symptoms, on the other hand, differs from  woman to woman, depending on their health, food, way of life, and other factors.  Women with menstrual-related issues have also reported smoking, alcohol intake,  and an increase in hunger. Furthermore, young women experience emotional  disturbances such as melancholy, restlessness, and despair. It is a sign of an  atypical menstrual cycle if there is no cycle or if the bleeding is atypical or  light. As a result, it is critical to maintain contact with a gynaecologist in  order to detect any significant changes in a regular menstrual cycle.  © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

Prior research has shown that onset or exacerbation of OCD is associated with  menstruation, pregnancy, and the post-partum period. However, the underlying  cause is unclear. The goal of this study was to assess whether pregnancy and  birth complications were associated with OCD symptoms exacerbation, among women  with established OCD. Two-hundred and five (n=205) women with OCD  retrospectively reported information on their physical and mental health during  their first pregnancy. Over a third of the sample (34%) reported an exacerbation  in their OCD symptoms. History of pregnancy and birth complications in the first  pregnancy were similar between women who did and did not experience symptom  exacerbation, with the exception of gestational diabetes, which was  significantly more common among women who experienced exacerbation (7% vs 1%,  p=0.03). In a multivariable logistic regression model, gestational diabetes  remained significantly associated with exacerbation of OCD symptoms (OR=8.44  [95% CI 1.37-77.27]; p=0.03), even after adjusting for maternal age, OCD  severity and treatment, premenstrual OCD symptom increase, stress during  pregnancy, and major depression or anxiety disorder diagnosis during pregnancy.  We discuss potential explanations for this link. These findings should be  treated as hypothesis-generating and need to be replicated in a larger,  prospective study.

This study aimed to examine whether the menstrual cycles of women with regular  cycles have been affected by the COVID 19 pandemic. This cross-sectional online  survey study evaluated the menstrual cycle characteristics of women in the  reproductive phase of their lives during the COVID-19 pandemic in May 2020.  Changes before and after COVID-19 were evaluated with a paired sample t-test and  chi-square test. A Pearson correlation test was used to show the relationships  between variables. The study was completed with 263 participants in total. The  average age of the participants was 26.3 ± 6.9 (18-45). Participants' duration  of period (p = .003) and pads used per day (p = .002) decreased compared to  their experience before the COVID-19 outbreak. The mean total MSQ score was  3.1 ± 0.8 (0-4), mean STAI-1 score was 45.1 ± 9 (20-78) and mean STAI-II score  was 43.3 ± 5.9 (30-69). It was found that STAI-I and STAI-II scores showed a  positive correlation with MSQ-Somatic subgroup scores(r = 0.153, p = .013;  0.190, p = .002) and MSQ-Total scores (0.144, p = .020; 0.175, p = .004). With  the COVID-19 pandemic, increased anxiety scores increased women's menstrual  symptoms while the length of periods and the number of pads used  decreased.Impact statementWhat is already known on this subject? The COVID 19  pandemic, has caused enormous psychological distress potentially resulting in  the development of posttraumatic stress disorder. The menstrual cycle is a  process that can be affected by psychological stress.What do the results of this  study add? This is the first study to examine the relationship between stress  caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the menstrual cycle. The increases in the  degree of anxiety and stress as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak was found to  be high enough to affect the characteristics of the menstrual cycle in the women  surveyed.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice  and/or further research? In a prospective study intended to be carried out after  the outbreak ends in the future, it will be possible to evaluate whether the  menstrual cycle parameters return to their former order and consequently this  hypothesis will be able to be more definitively confirmed.

INTRODUCTION: Service women face female-specific challenges that present  physiological and logistical burdens and may impact readiness. The stress of  training can change menstrual patterns and symptoms, and limited access to  hygienic, private facilities can hinder menstrual management. Therefore,  suppressing menses with continuous hormonal contraception may be of interest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 9-item ""Military Women's Attitudes Toward Menstrual  Suppression."" questionnaire was administered to female officers upon entry  (baseline) and graduation (post) from a 6-month secondary training course.  Respondents rated their attitudes about menstruation and the stress of training,  the desire for menstrual suppression, and the logistical burden of menstruation  on a 1 (strongly agree) through 5 (strongly disagree) scale. Wilcoxon Signed  Rank Tests determined changes in the distribution of responses from baseline to  post. RESULTS: Female officers (n = 108) completed baseline and post questionnaires  (age 25.2 ± 0.3 years). At baseline, the majority disagreed/strongly disagreed  that the stress of training ""makes periods worse than usual"" (n = 77, 71%),  ""increases menstrual symptoms and bleeding"" (n = 77, 71%), or ""magnifies  premenstrual syndrome"" (PMS; n = 69, 64%). Although 50% (n = 54) agreed/strongly  agreed that ""stopping periods while women are training is a good idea,"" 37%  (n = 40) disagreed/strongly disagreed. The majority agreed/strongly agreed that  menstrual suppression would prevent ""the worry about menstrual supplies""  (n = 75, 70%) and ""the inconvenience of having a period during training""  (n = 69, 64%). Many agreed/strongly agreed that it is difficult to deal with  periods during training because ""there is no privacy"" (n = 52, 48%), ""the  inability to find adequate facilities"" (n = 70, 65%), and ""the lack of  opportunity to use adequate facilities"" (n = 52, 48%). Opinions remained largely  consistent from baseline to post. CONCLUSIONS: The desire for menstrual suppression among service women during  training is high. Military health care providers should be prepared to counsel  service women about strategies to manage menstruation, including the efficacy of  continuous hormonal contraception for menstrual suppression. Future studies  investigating benefits or risks of continuous hormonal contraception for  menstrual suppression in service women should inform the clinical  recommendations.  © The Association of Military Surgeons of the United States 2021.

OBJECTIVES: We occasionally encounter patients with familial Mediterranean fever  (FMF) whose attacks are triggered by specific factors; however, information  regarding these factors is limited. Our purpose was to identify the factors that  trigger febrile attacks in Japanese patients with FMF. METHODS: Our retrospective study included 372 patients (229 women, 143 men) with  FMF, who were diagnosed between April 2007 and June 2018. We retrospectively  investigated clinical features, genetic variants, and the factors that the  patients perceived to have triggered their attacks. Patients completed a  questionnaire that included the following triggering factors, anxiety,  psychological stress, tiredness, excitement, environmental change, and  menstruation. RESULTS: Of 372 patients, 180 (49.4%) reported some triggering factors.  Psychological stress and tiredness were commonly reported factors regardless of  sex; however, menstruation (39.7%, n=91) was the most commonly reported  triggering factor in female patients with FMF. Menstrual-related patients had a  younger age of onset and diagnosis, a higher frequency of peritonitis, and a  higher rate of patients with endometriosis compared with the  non-menstrual-related patients. CONCLUSIONS: Gaining an understanding of these triggering factors could help to  reduce attacks and educate the patients. Clinicians may need to consider FMF for  patients who have fever and serositis that occurs with every menstrual period.  PMID: 33200741 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Hum Reprod Update. 2021 Jan 4;27(1):130-153. doi: 10.1093/humupd/dmaa032.  Recovery of menses after functional hypothalamic amenorrhoea: if, when and why.  Pape J(1), Herbison AE(2), Leeners B(1)(3).  Author information: (1)Department of Reproductive Endocrinology, University Hospital Zurich, 8091  Zurich, Switzerland. (2)Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of  Cambridge CB2 3EG, UK. (3)University of Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland.  BACKGROUND: Prolonged amenorrhoea occurs as a consequence of functional  hypothalamic amenorrhoea (FHA) which is most often induced by weight loss,  vigorous exercise or emotional stress. Unfortunately, removal of these triggers  does not always result in the return of menses. The prevalence and conditions  underlying the timing of return of menses vary strongly and some women report  amenorrhoea several years after having achieved and maintained normal weight  and/or energy balance. A better understanding of these factors would also allow  improved counselling in the context of infertility. Although BMI, percentage  body fat and hormonal parameters are known to be involved in the initiation of  the menstrual cycle, their role in the physiology of return of menses is  currently poorly understood. We summarise here the current knowledge on the  epidemiology and physiology of return of menses. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: The aim of this review was to provide an overview of  (i) factors determining the recovery of menses and its timing, (ii) how such  factors may exert their physiological effects and (iii) whether there are useful  therapeutic options to induce recovery. SEARCH METHODS: We searched articles published in English, French or German  language containing keywords related to return of menses after FHA published in  PubMed between 1966 and February 2020. Manuscripts reporting data on either the  epidemiology or the physiology of recovery of menses were included and  bibliographies were reviewed for further relevant literature. The Strengthening  the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) criteria served  to assess quality of observational studies. OUTCOMES: Few studies investigate return of menses and most of them have serious  qualitative and methodological limitations. These include (i) the lack of  precise definitions for FHA or resumption of menses, (ii) the use of short  observation periods with unsatisfactory descriptions and (iii) the inclusion of  poorly characterised small study groups. The comparison of studies is further  hampered by very inhomogeneous study designs. Consequently, the exact prevalence  of resumption of menses after FHA is unknown. Also, the timepoint of return of  menses varies strongly and reliable prediction models are lacking. While weight,  body fat and energy availability are associated with the return of menses,  psychological factors also have a strong impact on the menstrual cycle and on  behaviour known to increase the risk of FHA. Drug therapies with metreleptin or  naltrexone might represent further opportunities to increase the chances of  return of menses, but these require further evaluation. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: Although knowledge on the physiology of return of menses is  presently rudimentary, the available data indicate the importance of BMI/weight  (gain), energy balance and mental health. The physiological processes and  genetics underlying the impact of these factors on the return of menses require  further research. Larger prospective studies are necessary to identify clinical  parameters for accurate prediction of return of menses as well as reliable  therapeutic options.  © The Author(s) 2020.

Author information: (1)Women's Health and Exercise Lab, Department of Kinesiology, College of Health  and Human Development, The Pennsylvania State University, PA 16803, USA.  We (i) identified alternative scoring strategies for the Female Athlete Triad  Coalition cumulative risk assessment (CRA) tool to be utilized when particular  risk factors (bone mineral density (BMD), oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea) cannot be  determined; (ii) objectively defined dietary restriction for use in the CRA  tool; and (iii) explored proxy measures of energy deficiency. This  cross-sectional investigation of exercising women (n = 166) utilized an existing  database derived from multiple studies designed to assess health, exercise, and  menstrual function. Data from the screening/baseline period of each study  included: anthropometrics, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, disordered eating  questionnaires, descriptive data, and proxy measures of energy deficiency (total  triiodothyronine (TT3) and ratio of measured-to-predicted resting metabolic rate  (mRMR/pRMR)). Substituting delayed menarche for BMD was the best-fit replacement  resulting in 15 (9%) participants being categorized in different clearance  categories. When menstrual status cannot be assessed, such as during hormonal  contraceptive use, low energy availability (EA) determined using self-report and  disordered eating questionnaires was the best substitution, resulting in 34  (20%) participants being categorized in different clearance categories. Based on  original clearance categorizations, the provisional group had lower TT3 (78.3 ±  2.2 ng/dL; 92.7 ± 2.7 ng/dL) and Harris-Benedict mRMR/pRMR (0.85 ± 0.01; 0.90 ±  0.01) than the full group. Until an updated risk assessment tool is developed,  delayed menarche can substitute for low BMD and low EA for  oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea. Novelty This investigation addresses previous  limitations of the Triad CRA tool. Disordered eating questionnaires can be used  to objectively identify dietary restriction for the low EA risk factor. When a  risk factor cannot be assessed, delayed menarche can substitute for low BMD and  low EA for oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea.  DOI: 10.1139/apnm-2020-0131 PMID: 32502379 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

(2)Department of Psychiatry, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL,  USA.  BACKGROUND: The risk for depression markedly rises during the 5-6 years leading  up to the cessation of menstruation, known as the menopause transition. Exposure  to extreme estradiol levels may help explain this increase but few studies have  examined individual sensitivity to estradiol in predicting perimenopausal  depression. METHOD: The current study recruited 101 perimenopausal women. During Phase 1, we  quantified each woman's sensitivity to changes in estradiol using 12 weekly  measures of estrone-3-glucuronide (E1G), a urinary metabolite of estradiol, and  concurrent depressive symptoms. The weekly cortisol awakening response was  measured to examine the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in mediating  mood sensitivity to estradiol. In Phase 2, depressive symptoms and major  depression diagnoses were assessed monthly for 9 months. The relationship  between Phase 1 E1G sensitivity and Phase 2 depressive symptoms and major  depressive episodes was examined. Several baseline characteristics were examined  as potential moderators of this relationship. RESULTS: The within-person correlation between weekly E1G and mood varied  greatly from woman to woman, both in strength and direction. Phase 1 E1G mood  sensitivity predicted the occurrence of clinically significant depressive  symptoms in Phase 2 among certain subsets of women: those without a prior  history of depression, reporting a low number of baseline stressful life events,  and reporting fewer months since their last menstrual period. HPA axis  sensitivity to estradiol fluctuation did not predict Phase 2 outcomes. CONCLUSION: Mood sensitivity to estradiol predicts risk for perimenopausal  depression, particularly among women who are otherwise at low risk and among  those who are early in the transition.

(4)Department of Biopathology, Aretaieion Hospital, Athens, Greece.  Menopause is the condition in which the gradual decline in ovarian function  finally leads to the permanent cessation of menstruation. Oestrogen deficiency  may cause early symptoms during the menopausal transition and late symptoms  after menopause. Menopause is a normal period of life. During this period, women  need adaptation to new biological, social, and psychological parameters.  Vasomotor symptoms are among the most common menopausal symptoms. Menopause per  se is not correlated with specific psychiatric disorders, but data suggest that  perimenopausal women are more likely to develop depressive disorders even  without a previous history. Vasomotor symptoms are correlated with mood and  sleep disturbances, neuroticism, anxiety, decreased cognitive function, and  stress. Personality traits, social, and other factors are also important  mediators of vasomotor symptoms during the menopausal transition phase. This is  a review based on the existing evidence concerning the correlation between  psychosomatic and vasomotor symptoms of menopause during the menopausal  transition period. Healthcare providers should take these correlations into  consideration when planning the treatment of vasomotor symptoms. Vasomotor  symptoms during menopause are associated with significant social costs. There  are numerous traditional hormone therapy, and complementary and alternative  therapy including over-the-counter treatments and dietary supplements for  managing menopause-related vasomotor symptoms. Additional costs include  follow-up physician visits, laboratory testing, management of adverse events,  and loss of productivity at work. Social support and planning may help women to  deal with menopausal symptoms and may reduce overall social costs during this  transitional phase.

Higher concentrations of oxidative stress biomarkers are found in women with  polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and endometriosis, conditions linked to  irregular menstrual cycles and menstrual pain. The aim of the present study was  to test whether women with higher oxidative stress are more likely to show  irregular menstrual cycles and severe menstrual pain compared with women with  lower oxidative stress. A cross-sectional study was conducted targeting female  university students with a mean (SD) age of 20.5 (1.8) years (n = 188).  Participants completed a questionnaire on reproductive characteristics and  anthropometry and kept a menstrual cycle diary for 5 consecutive months. Urinary  8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), cotinine, and creatinine concentrations  were measured once during the study period. The mean (SD) value of the urinary  8-OHdG concentration was 4.7 (2.0) μg/g of creatinine. A total of 1021 menstrual  cycles were recorded. The participants were categorized as either having regular  (68%) or irregular (18%) cycles or oligomenorrhea (13%) or polymenorrhea (1%).  The urinary 8-OHdG concentration did not significantly differ across menstrual  cycle regularity or pain categories. Even after adjusting for age, body mass  index (BMI), and urinary cotinine concentrations, having irregular cycles or  more severe menstrual pain was not associated with urinary 8-OHdG concentration.

Triggers, Protectors, and Predictors in Episodic Migraine.  Marmura MJ(1).  Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, Jefferson Headache Clinic, Thomas Jefferson  University, Philadelphia, PA, USA. Michael.marmura@jefferson.edu.  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: A wide variety of triggers prompt attacks in episodic  migraine. Although experimental triggers such as glyceryl trinitrate reliably  produce migraine, natural triggers are much less predictable and vary in  importance between individuals. This review describes the most common triggers  in episodic migraine and provides strategies for managing them in clinical  practice. RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple migraine attack triggers have been established based  on patient surveys, diary studies, and clinical trials. Stress, menstrual cycle  changes, weather changes, sleep disturbances, alcohol, and other foods are among  the most common factors mentioned. Clinical studies have verified that fasting,  premenstrual periods in women, ""letdown"" after stress, and most likely low  barometric pressures are migraine triggers. Premonitory symptoms such as neck  pain, fatigue, and sensitivity to lights, sounds, or odors may mimic triggers.  Multiple studies clearly demonstrate triggers in episodic migraine, often  related to change in homeostasis or environment. Many common migraine triggers  are not easily modifiable, and avoiding triggers may not be realistic. Healthy  lifestyle choices such as exercise, adequate sleep, stress management, and  eating regularly may prevent triggers and transformation to chronic migraine  over time.

BACKGROUND: In recent years, cold hypersensitivity in the hands (CHH) has become  a common ailment of women in Korea. It can lead to gynecological problems such  as irregular menstruation, miscarriage, and infertility. Traditionally, Korean  herbal medicine has been the primary treatment method used to balance  thermoregulation in the human body; however, its effectiveness has not been  confirmed through systematic study. Thus, in this trial, we will investigate the  feasibility of a full randomized clinical trial,  Danggui-Sayuk-Ga-Osuyu-Saenggang-tang (DSGOST) in Korean women with CHH. METHODS: This study will be a pilot, multicenter, double-blind, randomized,  parallel-group, two-arm, placebo-controlled clinical trial. A total of 66  participants will be randomly divided into two groups, a DSGOST treatment group  and a placebo control group, in a 1:1 ratio using a web-based randomization  system. Each group will take DSGOST or placebo three times daily for 6 weeks.  The primary outcome will be measured using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores of  CHH. Secondary outcomes will include changes in skin temperature of the hands,  Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) scale scores, recovery rate of skin  temperature of the hands after the cold stress test, and the Korean version of  the WHO Quality of Life Scale, abbreviated version (WHOQOL-BREF). DISCUSSION: This trial will be the first trial to reflect the newly defined  disease range of CHH which was compiled by Korean medicine expert consensus.  This study will provide considerable evidence for further large-scale trials and  general clinical guidelines for CHH in the Korean medical field. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, ID:  NCT02645916 . Registered on 30 December 2015.

27380769,Factors impacting on menstrual hygiene and their implications for health promotion.,"Lahme AM, Stern R, Cooper D","1. Glob Health Promot. 2018 Mar;25(1):54-62. doi: 10.1177/1757975916648301. Epub  2016 Jul 5.  Factors impacting on menstrual hygiene and their implications for health  promotion.  Lahme AM(1), Stern R(2), Cooper D(2).  Author information: (1)1 Akros Global Health, Lusaka, Zambia. (2)2 University of Western Cape - School of Public Health, Cape Town, South  Africa.  BACKGROUND: In the lives of women, puberty is marked by the onset of menarche.  From this stage onwards until menopause, reproductive health and menstrual  hygiene are important aspects of women's lives. In Zambia's Western Province,  the natural process of menstruation is a taboo and dealt with secretly.  Information and knowledge about menstruation and menstrual hygiene among  adolescent girls is inadequate. This paper explores the factors influencing the  understanding, experiences and practices of menstrual hygiene among adolescent  girls in Mongu District, Western Province of Zambia. METHODS: An explorative study design was used by means of six focus group  discussions conducted with 51 respondents, aged 13-20 years, from three  secondary schools. Their age at menarche was 11-15. For data analysis thematic  content analysis was used. RESULTS: The paper shows that the girls suffer from poor menstrual hygiene,  originating from lack of knowledge, culture and tradition, and socio-economic  and environmental constraints, leading to inconveniences, humiliation and  stress. This leads to reduced school attendance and poor academic performance,  or even drop outs, and ultimately infringes upon the girls' human rights. CONCLUSION: To address these shortcomings, a 'super setting approach' is  recommended, in which a Health Promoting School could improve the girls'  individual and group needs, and a community setting which would address the  broader socio-economic, cultural and environmental conditions. This would enable  creating a supportive environment for the girls to manage their periods. To  successfully utilize the approach, all stakeholders (parents, teachers,  children, governments and communities) should cooperate to generate  context-specific solutions for creating safe menstrual care, and better and  dignified conditions for adolescent girls. Therefore, this calls for  comprehensive, strident advocacy for policy changes at national level, and  mediation and involvement at community level.

(2)2 Division of Biomedical Statistics and Informatics, Mayo Clinic , Rochester,  Minnesota.  BACKGROUND: Many women have heavy menstrual bleeding during perimenopause that  may interfere with overall quality of life and contribute to sexual dysfunction.  We aimed to determine whether sexual function in women improves after  endometrial ablation for heavy menstrual periods. METHODS: Validated surveys (Female Sexual Function Index [FSFI], Female Sexual  Distress Scale [FSDS], and Short-Form Health Survey [SF-12]) were administered  to 136 women before and after endometrial ablation from August 2008 through June  2013. Scores at baseline and 6 months after surgery were compared using the  paired t test. RESULTS: A total of 97 women completed the FSFI and FSDS surveys at baseline and  6 months after ablation. Mean full-scale FSFI score increased from 26.5 to 28.8  (p < .001), with improvement in 5 of 6 FSFI domains. Mean FSDS score decreased  from 13.6 to 9.7 (p < .001), showing decreased personal distress regarding  sexual function. In assessing quality of life, SF-12 scores improved for global  physical function (p < .001) and mental function (p = .002). CONCLUSIONS: Female sexual function improved and personal distress associated  with sexual function decreased after endometrial ablation for heavy menstrual  cycles.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of stress fractures, menstrual  dysfunction and disordered eating attitudes in elite female soccer athletes. DESIGN: Cross-sectional descriptive study. SETTING: Female soccer athletes were recruited from a national level youth  soccer club, an NCAA Division I university team, and a women's professional  team. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred twenty female soccer athletes with a mean age of 16.4  ± 4 years and BMI of 20.8 ± 2 kg/m(2) completed the study, representing all  athletes from the included teams. METHODS: One-time surveys completed by the athletes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Height and weight were recorded, and body mass index  (BMI) was calculated for each athlete. Athletes reported age of menarche,  history of missing 3 or more menses within a 12-month period and stress  fracture. The Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-26) was used to assess the athlete's  body perception and attitudes toward eating. RESULTS: Of the 220 soccer athletes, 3 athletes (1.6%) had a low BMI for their  age, and 19 (8.6%) reported stress fractures of the lower extremity. Among  athletes who had reached menarche, the average onset was 13 + 1 year; menstrual  dysfunction were present in 21 (19.3%). On the EAT-26, 1 player scored in the  high risk range (>20) and 17 (7.7%) scored in the intermediate risk range  (10-19) for eating disorders. Athletes with an EAT-26 score ≥ 10 points had a  significantly higher prevalence of menstrual dysfunction in the past year  compared to athletes with an EAT-26 score of less than 10 (P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: Elite female soccer athletes are susceptible to stress fractures  and menstrual dysfunction and have delayed onset of menarche despite normal BMI  and appropriate body perception and attitudes towards eating. Further studies  are needed to better understand stress fracture risk in female soccer athletes  and in other team sports to determine how these findings relate to long-term  bone health in this population.

JAMA Intern Med. 2015 Sep;175(9):1586. doi: 10.1001/jamainternmed.2015.3577.  IMPORTANCE: The expected duration of menopausal vasomotor symptoms (VMS) is  important to women making decisions about possible treatments. OBJECTIVES: To determine total duration of frequent VMS (≥ 6 days in the  previous 2 weeks) (hereafter total VMS duration) during the menopausal  transition, to quantify how long frequent VMS persist after the final menstrual  period (FMP) (hereafter post-FMP persistence), and to identify risk factors for  longer total VMS duration and longer post-FMP persistence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Study of Women's Health Across the Nation  (SWAN) is a multiracial/multiethnic observational study of the menopausal  transition among 3302 women enrolled at 7 US sites. From February 1996 through  April 2013, women completed a median of 13 visits. Analyses included 1449 women  with frequent VMS. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Total VMS duration (in years) (hot flashes or night  sweats) and post-FMP persistence (in years) into postmenopause. RESULTS: The median total VMS duration was 7.4 years. Among 881 women who  experienced an observable FMP, the median post-FMP persistence was 4.5 years.  Women who were premenopausal or early perimenopausal when they first reported  frequent VMS had the longest total VMS duration (median, >11.8 years) and  post-FMP persistence (median, 9.4 years). Women who were postmenopausal at the  onset of VMS had the shortest total VMS duration (median, 3.4 years). Compared  with women of other racial/ethnic groups, African American women reported the  longest total VMS duration (median, 10.1 years). Additional factors related to  longer duration of VMS (total VMS duration or post-FMP persistence) were younger  age, lower educational level, greater perceived stress and symptom sensitivity,  and higher depressive symptoms and anxiety at first report of VMS. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Frequent VMS lasted more than 7 years during the  menopausal transition for more than half of the women and persisted for 4.5  years after the FMP. Individual characteristics (eg, being premenopausal and  having greater negative affective factors when first experiencing VMS) were  related to longer-lasting VMS. Health care professionals should counsel women to  expect that frequent VMS could last more than 7 years, and they may last longer  for African American women.

BACKGROUND: Preterm birth is the main cause of morbidity and mortality during  the perinatal period. Classical risk factors are held responsible for only 1/3  of preterm births and no current intervention has produced an appreciable  reduction of this event. It is necessary to explore new hypotheses and  mechanisms of causality by using an integrated approach, collaboration among  research groups and less fragmented theoretical-methodological approaches in  order to detect new risk factors and to formulate more effective intervention  strategies. METHODS: The study will be conducted on a convenience cohort of Brazilian  pregnant women recruited at public and private prenatal health services. A total  of 1500 pregnant women in São Luís, and 1500 in Ribeirão Preto, will be invited  for an interview and for the collection of biological specimens from the 22nd to  the 25th week of gestational age (GA). At the time of delivery they will be  reinterviewed. GA will be determined using an algorithm based on two criteria:  date of last menstruation (DLM) and obstetric ultrasound (OUS) performed at less  than 20 weeks of GA. Illicit drug consumption during pregnancy will be  determined using a self-applied questionnaire and the following instruments will  be used: perceived stress scale, Beck anxiety scale, screening for depression of  the Center of Epidemiological Studies (CES-D), experiences of racial  discrimination, social network and social support scale of the Medical Outcomes  Study and violence (Abuse Assessment Screening and violence questionnaire of the  WHO). Bacterial vaginosis, urinary tract infection and periodontal disease will  also be identified. Neuroendocrine, immunoinflammatory and medical intervention  hypotheses will be tested. The occurrence of elective cesarean section in the  absence of labor will be used as a marker of medical intervention. CONCLUSION: Psychosocial, genetic and infectious mechanisms will be selected,  since there are indications that they influence preterm birth (PTB). The studies  will be conducted in two Brazilian cities with discrepant socioeconomic  conditions. The expectation is to identify risk factors for PTB having a greater  predictive power than classically studied factors. The final objective is to  propose more effective interventions for the reduction of PTB, which, after  being tested, might subsidize health policies.

(4)Department of Community and Family Medicine, All India Institute of Medical  Sciences, Bhopal, India. (5)Department of Physiology, Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi, India.  BACKGROUND: Common neurological syndrome (migraine without aura) is more common  among women than men. Migraine is among the top 20 causes of disability.  Menstruation is known to be a powerful trigger for migraine, and so is stress,  but the presentation of headache is similar in both. Also, women are more  vulnerable to stress as well as migraine, and this makes a complex relationship  of menstruation, stress, and migraine. OBJECTIVE: This study was done to understand the association of hormonal  fluctuation in menstruation and stress with common migraine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional comparative study was conducted in 40  young adult females, of whom 20 participants were cases of migraine without aura  (18-35 years old), and the remaining 20 participants were age-matched controls.  The study was done in Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi. Study  participants were selected on the basis of International Headache Society  (ICHD-IIA1.1) (2004) classification. Study participants with neurological  disorders, chronic diseases, and disease suggestive of any hormonal disturbances  were excluded. Clinically diagnosed migraine cases were asked to maintain a  headache diary and to fill in the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales  questionnaire. Biochemical assessment of hormonal status for thyroid-stimulating  hormone, triiodothyronine, thyroxine, estrogen, follicle-stimulating hormone,  luteinizing hormone, and prolactin was also done on the second day of their  menstrual cycle. We used the Mann-Whitney U test to compare hormonal levels and  the χ (2) test to compare anxiety- or depression-related stress among the  migraine and nonmigraine groups. RESULTS: Significantly higher values of prolactin were observed in cases (mean ±  standard deviation, 152.7 mIU/L±30.5) compared to controls (76.1 mIU/L±8.7),  with a P-value <0.001. There was no statistically significant difference  observed in levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (P=0.081), estrogen (P=0.086),  luteinizing hormone (P=0.091), or follicle-stimulating hormone (P=0.478). Also,  anxiety with stress or depression with stress was significantly higher among the  migraine group than the controls (P=0.002). Odds of any stress in migraine were  higher in the migraine group than in the nonmigraine group (odds ratio 12, 95%  confidence interval 2.7-53.33). CONCLUSION: Migraine, particularly without aura, in women is mainly associated  with stress-related anxiety or depression, and are more susceptible to stress in  the premenstrual period.

(3)Saiseikai Nagasaki Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan. (4)Sasebo Chuo Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.  OBJECTIVES: Human heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) has been reported to enhance  Toll-like receptor 4-mediated pelvic inflammation and growth of endometriotic  cells. However, information on tissue expression of HSP70 before and after  treatment with estrogen suppressing agent is scanty. Here, we investigated  tissue expression HSP70 in the eutopic/ectopic endometria of  gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa)-treated and -non-treated women  with endometriosis. STUDY DESIGN: Biopsy specimens were collected from peritoneal lesions, cyst  walls, and corresponding endometria of 20 women with peritoneal endometriosis,  35 women with ovarian endometrioma, and 15 control women during laparoscopy.  Fifteen women with ovarian endometrioma were treated with GnRHa for a variable  period of 4-6 months before laparoscopy. The immunoexpressions of HSP70 and  CD68-positive macrophages (Mφ) in endometria, peritoneal lesions, and cyst walls  were examined by immunohistochemistry. The immunoreactivity of HSP70 in tissues  was analyzed by quantitative-histogram (Q-H) score. RESULTS: Tissue expression of HSP70 was found to be the highest in the menstrual  phase than in other phases of the menstrual cycle. A significantly higher  immunoreactivity of HSP70 was found in the eutopic endometria of women with  peritoneal and ovarian endometriosis than in controls and in opaque red lesions  than in other peritoneal lesions. A significant correlation between Q-H scores  of HSP70 and CD68-positive Mφ numbers was found in the endometria derived from  women with peritoneal endometriosis (r=0.481) and in ovarian endometrioma  (r=0.560) but not in control women. The Q-H scores of HSP70 expression were  significantly lower in cyst walls, coexisting peritoneal lesions and  corresponding endometria of women with ovarian endometrioma after GnRHa  treatment comparing to similar tissues derived from women without GnRHa  treatment. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that as a marker of tissue stress reaction,  immunoexpression of HSP70 was highly increased in pathological lesions and  endometria of women with endometriosis and had a significant correlation with  tissue inflammatory reaction.

We investigated whether sexual activity was associated with reproductive  function in the BioCycle Study, a prospective cohort study that followed 259  regularly menstruating women aged 18 to 44years for one (n=9) or two (n=250)  menstrual cycles in 2005-2007. Women were not attempting pregnancy nor using  hormonal contraceptives. History of ever having been sexually active was  assessed at baseline and frequency of sexual activity, defined as vaginal-penile  intercourse, was self-reported daily throughout the study. Serum concentrations  of estradiol, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH),  progesterone, and testosterone were measured up to 8times/cycle. Sporadic  anovulation was identified using peak progesterone concentration. Linear mixed  models were used to estimate associations between sexual activity and  reproductive hormone concentrations and generalized linear models were used to  estimate associations with sporadic anovulation. Models were adjusted for age,  race, body mass index, perceived stress, and alcohol consumption and accounted  for repeated measures within women. Elevated concentrations of estrogen (+14.6%,  P<.01), luteal progesterone (+41.0%, P<.01) and mid-cycle LH (+23.4%, P<.01),  but not FSH (P=.33) or testosterone (P=.37), were observed in sexually active  women compared with sexually inactive women (no prior and no study-period sexual  activity); sexually active women had lower odds of sporadic anovulation  (adjusted odds ratio=0.34, 95% confidence interval: 0.16-0.73). Among sexually  active women, frequency of sexual activity was not associated with hormones or  sporadic anovulation (all P>.23). Findings from our study suggest that ever  having been sexually active is associated with improved reproductive function,  even after controlling for factors such as age.  Published by Elsevier Inc.

The menopausal transition or ""perimenopause"" represents a time period of  turbulent changes in ovarian hormones as middle-aged women progress into  menopause. The purpose of this article is to review the literature to determine  the effect of the menopausal transition on migraine headaches and to develop a  rational treatment approach to these patients. The menopausal transition is  divided into early and stages based upon patterns of menstruation and specific  reproductive hormones. Studies would suggest that the prevalence of migraine and  other climacteric symptoms tend to peak during the late menopausal transition  particularly in those with a past history of premenstrual stress disorder.  Treatment approaches vary by stage of the menopausal transition and include  conventional daily preventatives, mini-prophylaxis and hormonal therapies.

CONTEXT: Puberty is a crucial period of dramatic hormonal changes, accelerated  growth, attainment of reproductive capacity, and acquisition of peak bone mass.  Participation in recreational physical activity is widely acknowledged to  provide significant health benefits in this period. Conversely, intense training  imposes several constraints, such as training stress and maintenance of very low  body fat to maximize performance. Adolescent female athletes are therefore at  risk of overtraining and/or poor dietary intake, which may have several  consequences for endocrine function. The ""adaptive"" changes in the  hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal, -adrenal, and somatotropic axes and the  secretory role of the adipose tissue are reviewed, as are their effects on  growth, menstrual cycles, and bone mass acquisition. DESIGN: A systematic search on Medline between 1990 and 2013 was conducted using  the following terms: ""intense training,"" ""physical activity,"" or ""exercise""  combined with ""hormone,"" ""endocrine,"" and ""girls,"" ""women,"" or ""elite female  athletes."" All articles reporting on the endocrine changes related to intense  training and their potential implications for growth, menstrual cycles, and bone  mass acquisition were considered. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Young female athletes present a high prevalence of  menstrual disorders, including delayed menarche, oligomenorrhea, and amenorrhea,  characterized by a high degree of variability according to the type of sport.  Exercise-related reproductive dysfunction may have consequences for growth  velocity and peak bone mass acquisition. Recent findings highlight the endocrine  role of adipose tissue and energy balance in the regulation of homeostasis and  reproductive function. A better understanding of the mechanisms whereby intense  training affects the endocrine system may orient research to develop innovative  strategies (ie, based on nutritional or pharmacological approaches and  individualized modalities of training and competition) to improve the medical  care of these adolescents and protect their reproductive function.

Reynolds-May MF(1), Kenna HA, Marsh W, Stemmle PG, Wang P, Ketter TA, Rasgon NL.  Author information: (1)Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University School  of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.  OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present study was to investigate the reproductive  function of women with bipolar disorder (BD) compared to healthy controls. METHODS: Women diagnosed with BD and healthy controls with no psychiatric  history, aged 18-45 years, were recruited from a university clinic and  surrounding community. Participants completed a baseline reproductive health  questionnaire, serum hormone assessment, and ovulation tracking for three  consecutive cycles using urine luteinizing hormone (LH)-detecting strips with a  confirmatory luteal-phase serum progesterone. RESULTS: Women with BD (n = 103) did not differ from controls (n = 36) in  demographics, rates of menstrual abnormalities (MAs), or number of  ovulation-positive cycles. Of the women with BD, 17% reported a current MA and  39% reported a past MA. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and  17-hydroxyprogesterone levels were higher in controls (p = 0.052 and 0.004,  respectively), but there were no other differences in biochemical levels.  Medication type, dose, or duration was not associated with MA or biochemical  markers, although those currently taking an atypical antipsychotic agent  indicated a greater rate of current or past MA (80% versus 55%, p = 0.013). In  women with BD, 22% reported a period of amenorrhea associated with exercising or  stress, versus 8% of controls (p = 0.064). Self-reported rates of bulimia and  anorexia nervosa were 10% and 5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of MA and biochemical levels did not significantly differ  between women with BD and controls. Current atypical antipsychotic agent use was  associated with a higher rate of current or past MA and should be further  investigated. The incidence of stress-induced amenorrhea should be further  investigated in this population, as should the comorbid incidence of eating  disorders.  © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

(2)University of Texas Medical Branch, School of Medicine, Galveston, TX, USA.  Sex differences in sleep begin at a very early age and women report poorer sleep  quality and have higher risk for insomnia than do men. Sleep may be affected by  variation in reproductive hormones, stress, depression, aging, life/role  transitions, and other factors. The menstrual cycle is associated with changes  in circadian rhythms and sleep architecture. Menstruating women (even without  significant menstrual-related complaints) often report poorer sleep quality and  greater sleep disturbance during the premenstrual week compared to other times  of her menstrual cycle. In addition to these sleep disturbances, women with  severe premenstrual syndrome often report more disturbing dreams, sleepiness,  fatigue, decreased alertness and concentration during the premenstrual phase.  Sleep disturbances are also commonly reported during pregnancy and increase in  frequency and duration as the pregnancy progresses. The precipitous decline in  hormones and unpredictable sleep patterns of the newborn contribute to and/or  exacerbate poor sleep and daytime sleepiness during the early postpartum period.  Insomnia is also among the most common health complaints that are reported by  perimenopausal women. Women are particularly vulnerable to developing insomnia  disorder during these times of reproductive hormonal change. In this review, we  present a discussion on the most relevant and recent publications on sleep  across the woman's lifespan, including changes in sleep related to menstruation,  pregnancy, postpartum, and the menopausal transition. Treatment for sleep  disturbances and insomnia disorder and special considerations for treating women  will also be discussed.

Most serous cancers appear to originate from  precursor lesions at the fimbriated tubal end, whereas most endometrioid and  clear cell cancers seem to derive from atypical endometriosis. Data regarding  hormonal factors and associated gynaecologic conditions were critically analysed  with the objective of defining a carcinogenic model for sporadic epithelial  ovarian cancer complying with epidemiologic and pathologic findings. Oral  contraceptives and tubal ligation substantially reduce the risk of serous,  endometrioid and clear cell subgroups, but have no significant effect on  mucinous tumours, which probably follow a different oncogenic pathway. We  hypothesize that serous, endometrioid and clear cell cancers share a common  pathogenic mechanism, i.e. iron-induced oxidative stress derived from retrograde  menstruation. Fimbriae floating in bloody peritoneal fluid are exposed to the  action of catalytic iron and to the genotoxic effect of reactive oxygen species,  generated from haemolysis of erythrocytes by pelvic macrophages. This would  explain the distal site of tubal intraepithelial neoplasia. Collection of blood  inside endometriomas would lead to the same type of genotoxic insult on gonadal  endometrial implants. This would explain why endometriosis-associated cancers  develop much more frequently in the ovary than at extragonadal sites. In women  not seeking conception, bilateral salpingectomy could be advised whenever  planning surgery for independent indications, thus possibly reducing cancer  risk, while preserving ovarian function. The use of oral contraceptives should  be favoured for prolonged periods of time, especially in women with  endometriosis, a population at doubled risk of gonadal malignancy.

Gend Med. 2010 Apr;7(2):166-78. doi: 10.1016/j.genm.2010.03.001.  Impact of serum estradiol on postprandial lipemia, oxidative stress, and  inflammation across a single menstrual cycle.  Bell HK(1), Bloomer RJ.  Author information: (1)University of Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA.  BACKGROUND: An abrupt rise in circulating lipids, oxidative stress, and  inflammatory biomarkers is a common finding after ingestion of a high-fat meal.  Estradiol, typically provided via hormone replacement therapy to postmenopausal  women, has been reported to possess lipidemic, antioxidant, and antiinflammatory  properties, all of which may minimize postprandial oxidative stress. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the postprandial  triglyceride (TG), oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses after a lipid  meal in menstruating women during the early follicular (days 1-3) and  preovulatory (day 14) phases of the menstrual cycle. METHODS: Healthy normolipidemic women (fasting blood TG, <200 mg/dL) with  regular menstrual cycles reported to the Cardiorespiratory/Metabolic Laboratory  at the University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee (October-December 2008) and  consumed an identical lipid meal (heavy whipping cream and water) on 2 separate  days during the menstrual cycle. Blood samples were collected premeal and 1, 2,  4, and 6 hours postmeal, then assayed for TG, malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen  peroxide, Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAL), nitrate/nitrite, and  C-reactive protein (CRP). The AUC was calculated for each variable, and a 2  (menstrual cycle phase) x 5 (time) ANOVA with Tukey post hoc testing was also  conducted. Estradiol concentration was measured in premeal samples for  verification of cycle phase. RESULTS: Ten women (mean [SD] age, 29 [11] years; 8 white, 2 black; body mass  index, 22 [3] kg/m(2)) participated in the study. Despite a higher serum  estradiol concentration on day 14 (113 [56] pg/mL) compared with the early  follicular phase (61 [34] pg/mL), the TG, oxidative stress, and inflammatory AUC  responses to feeding were not significantly different. TG (P = 0.03), MDA (P =  0.02), and hydrogen peroxide (P < 0.001) were significantly increased in  response to feeding (time effect), whereas nitrate/nitrite was decreased (P =  0.01). TEAC and CRP were not significantly affected. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that estradiol, at the concentrations noted in  the present study, had no significant effect on postprandial TG or biomarkers of  oxidative stress or inflammation in a sample of young, healthy women. It is  possible that a greater divergence in circulating estradiol may be needed for  significant differences to be detected, as may be the case with chronic hormone  replacement therapy in postmenopausal women.  2010 Excerpta Medica Inc.

Author information: (1)Division of Epidemiology, Statistics and Prevention Research, NICHD, NIH,  DHHS, Bethesda, Maryland, USA. gollenba@mail.nih.gov  OBJECTIVE: To examine the longitudinal relation between perceived stress in the  previous month and perimenstrual symptom severity across two cycles among  regularly menstruating, healthy women (n = 259). METHODS: At baseline (11 days before the first cycle), participants completed  the 4-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) for the previous month (first cycle  exposure) and questionnaires on lifestyle factors. On cycle day 22 of a  standardized 28-day cycle, participants again completed the PSS for the previous  week (second cycle exposure) and each week rated the severity (none, mild,  moderate, severe) of 17 psychological and physical symptoms (e.g., crying,  cramping, pain). Mixed models estimated the association between perceived stress  scores and number of moderate/severe symptoms and symptom severity scores,  allowing both stress and perimenstrual symptoms to vary by cycle. RESULTS: Adjusting for age, education, passive and active smoking, and  waist/height ratio (WHtR), high stress (fourth quartile PSS) was associated with  an increased risk of reporting >or=8 or more (OR 7.2, 3.3-15.8) and >or=5 (OR  2.5, 1.6-4.1) symptoms as moderate/severe during the perimenstrual period  compared with lower stress (quartiles one, two, and three). Stress scores were  positively (p < 0.0001) associated with increased symptom severity scores for  total, psychological, and physical symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: These analyses show that higher perceived stress precedes an  increased severity of perimenstrual symptoms. Stress reduction programs may be  an effective, nonpharmaceutical treatment for physical and psychological symptom  relief.

Author information: (1)Dipartimento di Psicologia DPSS, Università Degli Studi di Padova, via  Venezia 8, 35131 Padova, Italy. jeff.kiesner@unipd.it  The associations between physical and psychological symptoms of the menstrual  cycle have not been carefully studied in past research, but may lead to a better  understanding of the underlying mechanisms of these symptoms. The present study  examines the day-to-day co-variations among physical and psychological symptoms  of the menstrual cycle. These symptoms were evaluated on a daily basis across  one entire menstrual cycle, with a non-clinical sample of 92 university  students. Results showed that headaches, gastrointestinal problems, lower  abdominal bloating, skin changes, and breast changes, were all significantly  associated with higher levels of psychological symptoms; whereas back and joint  pain, lower abdominal cramps, cervical mucous, and menstrual flow, were not  associated with psychological symptoms. However, significant differences in  these associations were observed across individuals for back and joint pain,  headaches, lower abdominal cramps, skin changes, and menstrual flow: Whereas  some women demonstrated higher levels of psychological symptoms associated with  these physical symptoms, other women demonstrated lower levels of psychological  symptoms. Finally, correlations among the associations between physical and  psychological symptoms (slopes) demonstrated clear differences across the  different physical symptoms. These results indicate that, although higher levels  of some physical symptoms are associated with higher levels of psychological  symptoms, there are significant differences in the magnitude and direction of  these relations across individuals. Further consideration of physical symptoms  may provide useful information for understanding individual differences in  symptom profiles and response to steroid fluctuations, and for improving  differential diagnosis and treatment planning and evaluation.

Reprod Sci. 2007 Jan;14(1):66-72. doi: 10.1177/1933719106298214.  Orthostatic stress response during the menstrual cycle is unaltered in formerly  preeclamptic women with low plasma volume.  Courtar DA(1), Spaanderman ME, Janssen BJ, Peeters LL.  Author information: (1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University Hospital Maastricht,  Maastricht, The Netherlands.  Plasma volume (PV) varies with the menstrual cycle not only in healthy parous  controls (CON) but also in formerly preeclamptic women with a subnormal PV  (LPV). It is unknown whether formerly preeclamptic women with LPV are more  susceptible to orthostatic stress than healthy controls. In this study, the  authors compared autonomic responses to acute (standing from supine position)  and gradual (menstrual cycle) orthostatic stress between LPV and CON. In 11 LPV  (PV<or= 49 mL/kg lean body mass) and 7 CON, beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP) and  heart rate (HR) were measured in supine position and after an orthostatic stress  test, during the follicular phase (FP) and luteal phase (LP) of the menstrual  cycle. Spectral analysis (fast Fourier transform) was performed on beat-to-beat  signals to quantify the magnitude of the spontaneous BP and pulse interval (PI)  fluctuations. The absolute powers within the low-frequency (0.04-0.15 Hz) and  high-frequency (0.15-0.4 Hz) ranges of BP and PI were used as estimates for  sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, respectively. Baroreflex sensitivity  was calculated as the transfer function gain from low-frequency systolic BP to  PI. Differences between groups, menstrual phase, and response to standing were  compared by analysis of variance. Basal BP was comparable in both study groups.  However, basal PI and spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity were lower in LPV than  in CON. The autonomic responses to acute and gradual orthostatic stress were  similar in the 2 groups, irrespective of the phase of the menstrual cycle. The  cardiovascular response to acute and gradual orthostatic stress in both FP and  LP is comparable in LPV and CON.  DOI: 10.1177/1933719106298214 PMID: 17636218 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Santer M(1), Wyke S, Warner P.  Author information: (1)MRC Health Services Research Fellow, Division of Community Health Sciences,  University of Edinburgh Medical School, Edinburgh, UK. miriamcsanter@yahoo.co.uk  BACKGROUND: Heavy menstrual bleeding is a common symptom amongst women of  reproductive age, yet questions remain about why some women experience this as a  problem while others do not. We investigated the concerns of women who reported  heavy menstrual bleeding on questionnaire. METHODS: A cross-sectional postal survey and qualitative interviews were carried  out amongst a community-based sample of women in Lothian, Scotland. 906 women  aged 25 to 44 reported heavy or very heavy periods in response to a postal  survey of 2833 women registered with 19 general practices. Amongst those who had  reported heavy menstrual bleeding, analysis was carried out of responses to the  free text questionnaire item, ""What bothers you most about your periods?"" In  addition, 32 of these women participated in qualitative interviews and their  accounts were analysed to explore how menstrual symptoms and 'problems' with  periods were experienced. RESULTS: Even amongst this subgroup of women, selected on the basis of having  reported their periods as heavy in the survey, pain was the aspect of their  periods that 'most bothered' them, followed by heaviness, mood changes or  tiredness, and irregularity or other issues of timing. Interviewees' accounts  similarly suggested that a range of menstrual symptoms were problematic and some  women did not disentangle which was worst. Judgements of periods as a problem  were based on the impact of menstrual symptoms on daily life and this was  contingent on social circumstances such as type of paid work and other  responsibilities. Although women spoke readily of whether their periods were a  problem, there was less clarity in accounts of whether or not menstrual loss was  'heavy'; women said they made judgements based on what was normal for them,  degree of difficulty in containing blood loss and pattern of loss. CONCLUSION: Women with heavy periods are bothered by a range of menstrual  symptoms and their impact on everyday life.

Author information: (1)UCT/MRC Research Unit for Exercise Science and Sports Medicine, Department of  Human Biology, UCT School of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town, South  Africa. lisam@sports.uct.ac.za  OBJECTIVE: To investigate factors associated with menstrual dysfunction,  self-reported bone stress injuries and energy balance in women runners. METHODS: 613 runners were randomly sampled during the registration period for an  endurance event. Demographic information, including self-reported height and  weight, training and injury history and menstrual history, was collected by  questionnaire. RESULTS: Ultra-marathon (ULTRA) participants (n = 276) were significantly older  (mean (SD) 39 (8.2) vs 34 (10.5) years; p<0.001), lighter (58.2 (6.6) vs 59.6  (8.3) kg; p<0.05) and reported a higher training volume (p<0.001) than  half-marathon (HALF) participants (n = 337). Significantly more ULTRA subjects  than HALF subjects reported a previous bone stress injury (21% vs 14%; p<0.05).  There was no difference between the groups for menstrual status, but age at  menarche was later (p<0.01) in the ULTRA group. Data were combined according to  the absence (REG; n = 368/602 (61%)) or presence (IRREG; n = 234/602 (39%)) of a  history of menstrual irregularity. Subject morphology was similar between  groups, but the IRREG group had a higher self-reported measure on the  self-loathing subscale (SLSS; p<0.01). The whole group was then classified  according to current menstrual status, with 165 women being classified as  currently irregular. (OLIGO/AMEN; 11.6%) and 445 women as currently regular  (EUMEN; 88.4%). There were no morphological differences between the groups,  however the OLIGO/AMEN group had a later age of menarche (p<0.01) than the EUMEN  group. Further, women who reported a previous bone stress injury had higher SLSS  scores than those who did not (2.91 (0.98) vs 2.68 (0.84); p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: There may be two independent mechanisms associated with energy  balance, which are related to bone stress injuries, but may not necessarily be  related to menstrual dysfunction.

Effect of war on the menstrual cycle.  Hannoun AB(1), Nassar AH, Usta IM, Zreik TG, Abu Musa AA.  Author information: (1)American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.  ahannoun@aub.edu.lb  OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of a short period of war on the menstrual cycles  of exposed women. METHODS: Six months after a 16-day war, women in exposed villages aged 15-45  years were asked to complete a questionnaire relating to their menstrual history  at the beginning, 3 months after, and 6 months after the war. A control group,  not exposed to war, was also interviewed. The data collected were analyzed to  estimate the effect of war on three groups of women: those who stayed in the war  zone for 3-16 days (Group A), those who were displaced within 2 days to safer  areas (Group B), and women not exposed to war or displacement (Group C-control). RESULTS: More than 35% of women in Group A and 10.5% in Group B had menstrual  aberrations 3 months after the cessation of the war. These percentages were  significantly different from each other and from that in Group C (2.6%). Six  months after the war most women regained their regular menstrual cycles with the  exception of 18.6% in Group A. CONCLUSION: We found a short period of war, acting like an acute stressful  condition, resulted in menstrual abnormalities in 10-35% of women and is  probably related to the duration of exposure to war. This might last beyond the  war time and for more than one or two cycles. In most women the irregular cycles  reversed without any medical intervention. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II.

Author information: (1)Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University,  Jinan, Shandong, 250012, P. R China.  BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Among gynecologic malignant tumors, Ovarian cancer has  the second highest incidence and is the leading cause of death. Some factors are  related to the genesis of ovarian cancer, but the etiology is still unclear.  This study was to explore the risk factors and pathogenesis of ovarian cancer. METHODS: A total of 307 women with epithelial ovarian cancer and 307 matched  women with other benign diseases, treated simultaneously in 19 hospitals in  Shandong Province, were enrolled. Conditional univariate and multivariate  logistic regression models were used to analyze 105 factors. RESULTS: Univariate logistic regression analysis revealed the risk factors for  developing ovarian cancer included higher education, higher income, increased  years of ovulation, prolonged period of intrauterine device (IUD) placement,  high fat, sweet and meat diet, irregular defecation, constipation, occupation  contacting harmful substance, depressed, anxious, impatient, or stressed mood,  spirit stimulation, and family history of ovarian cancer in first-degree  relatives; the protective factors for preventing ovarian cancer included lower  education, prolonged menstrual cycle, prolonged interval between marriage and  pregnancy, multiple pregnancies, prolonged lactation, prolonged interval between  delivery and recovery of menstruation, hysterectomy, high vegetable and fruits  diet, and mild temper. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that  prolonged menstrual cycle, multiple pregnancies, high vegetable and fruits diet,  and mild temper were protective factors, while prolonged period of IUD  placement, high meat diet, and spirit stimulation were high-risk factors. CONCLUSION: The etiology of ovarian cancer involves interaction of many factors  rather than any single factor.  PMID: 16831280 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Am J Hum Biol. 2006 Jul-Aug;18(4):540-55. doi: 10.1002/ajhb.20530.  Explaining sex differences in dental caries prevalence: saliva, hormones, and  ""life-history"" etiologies.  Lukacs JR(1), Largaespada LL.  Author information: (1)Department of Anthropology, University of Oregon, Eugene, Oregon 97403-1218,  USA. jrlukacs@oregon.uoregon.edu  When dental caries rates are reported by sex, females are typically found to  exhibit higher prevalence rates than males. This finding is generally true for  diverse cultures with different subsistence systems and for a wide range of  chronological periods. Exceptions exist, but are not common. In this paper, we  present new data for sex differences in dental caries rates among the Guanches  (Tenerife, Canary Islands), summarize results of meta-analyses of dental caries  prevalence, and emphasize new research that stresses the critical role of female  hormones and life-history events in the etiology of dental caries. Among the  Guanches, corrected tooth-count caries rates for females (8.8%, 158/1,790) are  approximately twice the frequency of caries among males (4.5%, 68/1,498). Higher  caries prevalence among females is often explained by one of three factors: 1)  earlier eruption of teeth in girls, hence longer exposure of girls' teeth to the  cariogenic oral environment, 2) easier access to food supplies by women and  frequent snacking during food preparation, and 3) pregnancy. Anthropologists  tend to favor explanations involving behavior, including sexual division of  labor and women's domestic role in food production. By contrast, the causal  pathways through which pregnancy contributes to poorer oral health and higher  caries rates are deemphasized or discounted. This paper presents recent research  on physiological changes associated with fluctuating hormone levels during  individual life histories, and the impact these changes have on the oral health  of women. The biochemical composition of saliva and overall saliva flow rate are  modified in several important ways by hormonal fluctuations during events such  as puberty, menstruation, and pregnancy, making the oral environment  significantly more cariogenic for women than for men. These results suggest that  hormonal fluctuations can have a dramatic effect on the oral health of women,  and constitute an important causal factor in explaining sex differences in  caries rates.

McComb JJ(1), Qian XP, Veldhuis JD, J McGlone J, Norman RL.  Author information: (1)Department of Health Exercise and Sport Sciences, Texas Tech University,  Lubbock, TX 79409-3011, USA. jacalyn.mccomb@ttu.edu  Neuroendocrine adaptive responses to psychological stress include activation of  the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and sometimes suppression of the  hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. In women who experience chronic  stress, these responses are probably responsible for disturbances in the  menstrual cycle. In the present experiment, we investigated the effect of an  acutely stressful situation on the physiological and neuroendocrine responses in  college age women. We hypothesized that females who are experiencing some degree  of abnormal menstrual function or women who have less-robust cycles  (oligomenorrheic females) would exhibit differences in gonadotropin secretion  from eumenorrheic females when exposed to psychological stressors. Fifteen women  completed this study: eumenorrheic (n = 5) and oligomenorrheic women (n = 5) who  experienced a series of psychological stressors, and eumenorrheic controls (n =  5). Blood samples were taken at 10 min intervals for 8 h (09:00-17:00) in each  woman during the mid-follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. The psychological  stressors were administered for 1 h beginning at 13:00 h. Luteinizing hormone  (LH), growth hormone (GH) and cortisol were measured in each sample to assess  the effect of stress on secretion of these hormones. Deconvolution analysis was  used to analyze pulsatile hormone secretion and the approximate entropy (ApEn)  statistic analyzed the regularity of release of each hormone. Although, there  were significant changes in heart rate (HR), skin resistance (SR) and cortisol  levels in the stressed women during the psychological stressor compared to  resting baseline values but not in the controls, there was no difference in  either LH or GH secretion between women who experienced stress and those who did  not. Furthermore, there were no differences in the LH or GH secretion patterns  in the oligomenorrheic and eumenorrheic women exposed to the psychological  stressor.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the natural history of recurrent urinary tract  infections in women of childbearing age and to gain insight into their  consequences and the ideas of the patients. DESIGN: Historical cohort-study and interviews with patients. METHOD: All non-pregnant women in the age-range 15-49 years who had had > or =2  urinary tract infections in one year in the period 1990-1994 were selected with  the aid of the 'Continuous morbidity registration' (CMR) from four general  practices in Nijmegen, The Netherlands. The patients' files were used for  supplementary information. The risk of recurrence was calculated by the  Kaplan-Meier method. Patients between the ages of 15 and 35 who had had > or =2  urinary tract infections in one year in the period 2002-2003 were interviewed. RESULTS: Of the 115 women in the CMR-study group, 70 (61%) were younger than 30  years. The median duration of follow-up was 10.0 years. The risk of a new  recurrence within one year was 56%; the chance of remaining free of recurrences  for two years was 33%. The 115 patients underwent a total of 630 urinary tract  infections during the study period; an antibiotic was prescribed every time. 2  of the 115 patients developed pyelitis/pyelonephritis. An underlying abnormality  was found in one of the 12 patients that were referred. Of the 21 women that  were interviewed, 8 (38%) stayed away from school or work during the infection,  depending on the symptoms. Of the 18 women that were sexually active, 13 (72%)  did not want to have sex during the infection. 10 of the 21 women (48%) were  concerned about possible complications. A decreased resistance, cold on the  bladder, stress, menstruation and improper vaginal hygiene were most frequently  mentioned by the women as the cause ofthe urinary tract infections. When women  with recurrent urinary tract infections consult a general practitioner, the  latter can discuss their unjustified concerns and attributions.  PMID: 15909394 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Matchock RL(1), Susman EJ, Brown FM.  Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, The Pennsylvania State University, Altoona Campus,  Altoona, Pennsylvania 16601, USA. rlm191@psu.edu  PURPOSE: To examine the seasonality of menarche in a large sample of women from  the United States. METHODS: Retrospective data were collected on month of birth and menarche, age  of menarche, and latitude and altitude of residence from a sample of  approximately 3,000 U.S. women from the TREMIN Research Program and from a  college student population. RESULTS: Monthly analyses using observed (O) to expected (E) ratios indicated a  peak frequency of menarche in July (1.45) and January (1.19) and troughs in  February (0.75) and May (0.79). Collapsing the data into seasons also revealed  summer and winter peaks. Participants from a younger cohort (born after 1970)  had an earlier age of menarche than participants from an older cohort (born  before 1970). Older cohort participants also had a more pronounced  December-January frequency peak and younger cohort participants had a more  pronounced July frequency peak. Older cohort participants exhibited more  variability in menarcheal age as a function of menarche month and birth month.  Late-maturing participants (>14 years) had a larger December peak of menarche  frequencies. Spring-born participants exhibited less seasonality to their  menarche. Month of birth was not significantly associated with month of  menarche; however, fewer cases than expected occurred 3 months after the birth  month and more cases than expected occurred 6 months after the birth month. Age  of menarche and monthly distribution of menarche did not vary according to  latitude or altitude. CONCLUSIONS: Menarche seasonality is suggested to be a multifactor process  mediated by the most prominent seasonal time cue. Attention to these cues that  have been hypothesized to contribute to menarche seasonality (e.g., stress or  the photoperiod) may have practical implications for women's health, given some  of the risks associated with early menarche.

Both tasks decreased CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD19+  B cells, whereas they increased lymphocytes, granulocytes, NK cells, and NK cell  activity (NKCA). The mental arithmetic task had a greater impact than the cold  pressor task on changes in CD3+ T cells and in NK cells. Cardiovascular  reactivity to active stress was associated with increased NK cells and decreased  CD3+ T cells. Reduced cortisol levels during passive stress were associated with  decreased CD19+ B cells and with increased NK cells. The merits of this study  are that it controlled the following factors. Perceived stress during the two  tasks was matched; both tasks lasted long enough to elicit high-magnitude  responses; and the length of the intervening rest period minimized probable  carryover effects between tasks.

Author information: (1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, United Christian Hospital, Kwun  Tong, Kowloon, Hong Kong.  To evaluate the incidence and pattern of menstrual dysfunction in reproductive  age group women suffering acute musculoskeletal trauma, 198 women between 15 and  50 years of age admitted consecutively into an acute orthopaedic unit were  recruited over a 6-month period. The patients were then followed up for 6 months  with menstrual diaries to compare their menstrual pattern with their  preadmission status. Excluding those with significant menstrual problems before  admission, the menstrual pattern remained normal in 135 (68%) (EM), while 12  (6%) developed polymenorrhoea (PM), and 51 (25%) had oligomenorrhoea or  amenorrhoea (OAM) within the 6-month observation. The three groups did not  differ in their mean age, body mass index, parity or age of menarche, but  previous cycle lengths were shortest in the PM group (25.4 days, SD 7.64)  (p<0.05) and history of amenorrhoea in the previous one year was most common in  the OAM group (p<0.025). Univariate analysis showed the incidence of moderate to  major trauma,operative treatment, longer operative time, general anaesthesia,  blood transfusion and immobilisation were significantly higher in the PM and OAM  groups compared to the unchanged group (p<0.05). A logistic regression model  showed that general anaesthesia and longer surgical operations remained  significantly related to the development of menstrual dysfunction. We conclude  that the pattern of menstrual dysfunction after acute orthopaedic trauma  appeared to be dictated by the woman's pre-existing menstrual characteristics  and the stress of surgical treatment.

Measurements were taken in the 2  weeks before the diet (baseline) and again in the final 2 weeks of the diet to  attenuate menstrual cycle differences. A reduction in energy intake and  concomitant weight loss (5.80 +/- 1.65 kg) were accompanied by a significant  decline in systolic blood pressure (5.4%), heart rate (7.6%), and cortisol  concentration (13.6%). Fatigue and vigour on the Profile of Mood States (POMS)  questionnaire were adversely affected; however, subjective assessments of mood,  concentration, temperature sensitivity, appetite, and sleep quality using visual  analogue scales, were not significantly altered during the month-long period of  energy restriction. Motor performance, as assessed by hand-eye coordination,  improved with both a reduction in mean reaction time and improved accuracy in  response to visual stimuli. The very low-energy diet appeared to be neither  physiologically nor psychologically stressful. Beneficial effects were evident  with a reduction in BMI, reduced risk of cardiovascular stress, improved motor  performance, and a decline in physiological stress with dieting success.

Age and seasonal distribution of menarche in Korean girls.  Park SH, Shim YK, Kim HS, Eun BL.  PIP: This paper examines the menarchal age of Korean girls and its monthly  distribution to define the possible relationship between menarche and season.  Menarchal age is influenced by diverse factors such as hereditary, geography,  climate, psychological factors, socioeconomic status, body weight and height,  nutritional state, body fat and exercise as well as the presence of chronic  illness. In Korea, there is evidence of secular change toward earlier menarchal  age, where the average menarchal age was 14.8 in 1952, 14.4 years in 1979, 13.4  years in 1986, and 12.5 years in 1988. A cross-sectional study was conducted  from July 1993 to July 1995 among 4237 female middle and high school students,  aged 14-20 years, in Ansan, Korea, to obtain data on demographic  characteristics, menarchal age, month of menarche, and the menarchal age of the  participant's mother. Findings revealed that average menarchal age is 12.5 years  for the girls and 15.4 +or- 2.3 years for their mothers. Menarche is most common  in August and January (summer), January and December (winter) in decreasing  order. Seasonal pattern of menarche may also be related to the psychological  factors during school vacation such as relaxation, decrease stress from studies,  and/or physical rest.

Raftos M(1), Jackson D, Mannix J.  Author information: (1)School of Nursing, Griffith University, Nathan, Queensland, Australia.  raftos@aust.net  Information and messages concerning health-related issues are not confined to  material provided by official figures or sources. Much information exists in the  community and comes from a variety of sources. One such source is the media.  This paper reports the findings of a study conducted over a 12-month period of  advertisements for menstrual products in a selection of four monthly Australian  magazines (n = 48) directed towards young women. The study examined the way in  which menstruation and the menstrual experience were depicted in terms of page  space, textual content and visual images. Findings revealed that advertisements  for menstrual products provided confusing, conflicting and paradoxical messages.  These included stressing the normality of menstruation while also emphasising  the importance of keeping it hidden and secret. Menstruation was depicted as  being a state of tainted (idealised) femininity because of the potential for the  menstrual silence to be shattered by people finding out. Protection failure was  depicted as being the ultimate in tainted femininity and a result of a woman's  incorrect choice of product. Choosing menstrual-care products was depicted as  simple but, paradoxically, complex and confusing. Women were depicted as  liberated and sophisticated but images and language related to infancy were  used. Freedom and liberation were conferred by the use of the advertised  product. Overall, in common with previous studies, menstruation was depicted as  a crisis of hygiene that is a risk to femininity. Advertisements for pantyliners  suggest that femininity itself poses a threat to (idealised) femininity. This  study demonstrates the crucial role of the media as a source of health  information for young women.  DOI: 10.1046/j.1440-1800.1998.530174.x PMID: 9923315 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

METHODS: Over a 14-year period, 1981-1995, two questionnaires were administered,  one for women using the combined oral contraceptive pill (COC) and one for women  using the progestogen only pill (POP). RESULTS: More than one predisposing factor was usually present, the most common  being diarrhoea and/or vomiting in 39.0%. Antibiotics had been prescribed in  20.5%. COC failure was associated with a high incidence of menstrual disturbance  (37.1%). A history of a previous pill failure was obtained in 27.8%. Smoking was  a risk factor for women on the COC. Only 6.0% became pregnant during the first  month of pill use. As expected, POP users experienced a higher number of pill  failures in proportion to the market share, but excess weight and time of taking  did not appear to be risk factors. Most COCs failed according to the numbers  expected from the market share. CONCLUSIONS: Many pill failures could be averted by better information about  known or suspected risk factors, especially gastrointestinal upset and  interacting medications. Pill failure is one more reason to discourage smoking  in COC users.  PIP: Predisposing factors to oral contraceptive (OC) failure in reliable pill  takers were investigated in a survey of 769 women who presented to Wellington  (New Zealand) Hospital in 1981-95 for induced abortion. More than one  predisposing factor was found in the majority of cases of pill failure. The  highest percentage (37%) of pill failures occurred in women 20-24 years of age.  The most common risk factor was diarrhea and/or vomiting, present around the  time of conception in 39% of women. Another 21% took antibiotics during this  period. Menstrual disturbance prior to the pregnancy occurred in 37.1%--a rate  higher than that expected from studies of pill use. A history of previous pill  failure was present in 27.8%. Smoking was a risk factor in users of combined  OCs. 33.7% of women using the progestogen-only pill and 34.2% of combined OC  users were under severe stress at the time pregnancy occurred. As expected,  progestogen-only pill users experienced a higher rate of failure relative to the  market share, but excess weight and the time of pill taking were not risk  factors. These findings suggest a need for careful counseling about the  potential of gastrointestinal illness and interacting medications to compromise  pill effectiveness.

9696732,Interactions between the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the female reproductive system: clinical implications.,"Chrousos GP, Torpy DJ, Gold PW","1. Ann Intern Med. 1998 Aug 1;129(3):229-40. doi:  10.7326/0003-4819-129-3-199808010-00012.  Interactions between the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the female  reproductive system: clinical implications.  Chrousos GP, Torpy DJ, Gold PW.  The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis exerts profound, multilevel inhibitory  effects on the female reproductive system. Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)  and CRH-induced proopiomelanocortin peptides inhibit hypothalamic  gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion, whereas glucocorticoids suppress  pituitary luteinizing hormone and ovarian estrogen and progesterone secretion  and render target tissues resistant to estradiol. The  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is thus responsible for the ""hypothalamic""  amenorrhea of stress, which is also seen in melancholic depression,  malnutrition, eating disorders, chronic active alcoholism, chronic excessive  exercise, and the hypogonadism of the Cushing syndrome. Conversely, estrogen  directly stimulates the CRH gene promoter and the central noradrenergic system,  which may explain adult women's slight hypercortisolism; preponderance of  affective, anxiety, and eating disorders; and mood cycles and vulnerability to  autoimmune and inflammatory disease, both of which follow estradiol  fluctuations. Several components of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and  their receptors are present in reproductive tissues as autacoid regulators.  These include ovarian and endometrial CRH, which may participate in the  inflammatory processes of the ovary (ovulation and luteolysis) and endometrium  (blastocyst implantation and menstruation), and placental CRH, which may  participate in the physiology of pregnancy and the timing of labor and delivery.  The hypercortisolism of the latter half of pregnancy can be explained by high  levels of placental CRH in plasma. This hypercortisolism causes a transient  postpartum adrenal suppression that, together with estrogen withdrawal, may  partly explain the depression and autoimmune phenomena of the postpartum period.

Author information: (1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Chelsea & Westminster Hospital,  London, United Kingdom.  Comment in     Menopause. 1999 Summer;6(2):180-1.  The incidence of depressed mood is high in women before hysterectomy. This  finding is usually the effect of prolonged heavy periods, chronic pelvic pain,  and severe premenstrual syndrome that warrant the surgical treatment. The  therapeutic effects of hysterectomy thus include both the cure of physical  symptoms and improvement of mood. However, in women with preexisting psychiatric  illness or predisposing personality problems, depressed mood may persist or  occur with the stress of hysterectomy. Hysterectomy is commonly performed in the  perimenopausal age but also results in a premature ovarian failure. Thus,  ovarian hormone deficiency following hysterectomy may be responsible for the  negative effect on mood. The cyclical nature of such hormone-related depressed  states often remains unrecognized in the absence of menstruation; without  routine endocrinologic monitoring the need for estrogen replacement following  hysterectomy is often missed. Associated bilateral oophorectomy results in the  depletion of endogenous androgens, which also has a significant effect on mood.  Estrogen plus testosterone replacement following hysterectomy with or without  bilateral oophorectomy has been shown to reduce the incidence of depressed  state. The compliance with hormone replacement following hysterectomy is high in  the absence of withdrawal bleeding and the depressant effect of progestins on  mood. Therefore, a practice of regular endocrinologic monitoring following  hysterectomy to detect the need for estrogen replacement and a near-routine  replacement of combined estrogen and testosterone following bilateral  oophorectomy should be adopted to reduce the incidence of posthysterectomy  depression.

We studied the presentation of chronic daily headache in 258 patients from a  private headache practice, 50 men and 208 women. Chronic daily headache was  defined as headaches, occurring at least 5 days per week for at least 1 year.  Seventy-seven percent of the patients experienced the onset of headache before  the age of 30. The daily headaches were present on awakening in the morning or  came about in the course of the morning in 79% of the patients. In 53%, they  were worst in the afternoon or evening. The headaches awoke the patients at  night at least once per week in 36%. At least twice per week, they were  associated with nausea in 35% of the patients and with vomiting in 9%. Common  aggravating factors included light, physical activity, bending over, noise,  stress or tension, and menstruation. Ninety-four percent of the patients  experienced severe headaches in addition to the daily headaches. In 63%, the  severe headaches occurred 10 days per month or less. The daily caffeine intake  of the patients averaged 170 mg, and the daily analgesic intake, 1860 mg of  aspirin equivalents.

Exacerbation of myasthenia gravis during the menstrual period.  Leker RR(1), Karni A, Abramsky O.  Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, Hadassah University Hospital, Hebrew University and  Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel. leker@cc.huji.ac.il  BACKGROUND: Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder mediated by  antiacetylcholine receptor antibodies. It has long been suspected to exacerbate  during the menstrual period but this has never been adequately documented. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We questioned 120 female myasthenic patients of different  ages, about their myasthenic symptoms before and during the menstrual period. We  also evaluated the effect of medications, pain and stress during or before the  menstrual period on the exacerbation rate. Exclusion criteria were  postmenopausal age and incomplete information available in the questionnaire. RESULTS: Forty two premenopausal women with generalized disease were included in  the study. Twenty eight (67%) of the patients reported exacerbation of their  myasthenic symptoms 2 to 3 days prior to the menstrual period. This exacerbation  persisted in 22 of them to the third day of the menstrual period. In nine of the  women this clinical worsening necessitated an increased intake of medications  during the days prior to menstruation. No correlation could be found between the  presence of antiacetylcholine receptor antibodies, pain, stress, use of oral  contraceptives or the type of antimyasthenic therapy and the rate of  exacerbation before and during the menstrual period. CONCLUSIONS: (1) MG frequently exacerbates before and during the menstrual  period in 67% of MG patients. (2) The rate of exacerbation is unrelated to the  presence of stress or pain prior to or during the menstrual period. (3)  Different therapies directed against MG, as well as oral contraceptives do not  influence the clinical course. (4) Menstrual exacerbations occur in both  seronegative and seropositive patients. (5) These exacerbations may frequently  necessitate therapeutic changes.  DOI: 10.1016/s0022-510x(98)00031-8 PMID: 9559997 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Tarabusi M(1), Caputo AS, Volpe A, Facchinetti F.  Author information: (1)Department of Gynaecological Obstetrics and Pediatric Sciences, University of  Modena, Italy.  We measured reactivity to a stress paradigm during the premenstrual period in 19  women affected by Menstrually Related Disorders (MRD) and in 11 normal controls.  Eight had premenstrual syndrome diagnosed by the Menstrual Distress  Questionnaire and 11 suffered menstrual migraine, diagnosed according to  International Headache Society criteria. Subjects were observed during two  menstrual cycles and submitted to a psychocognitive test (Stroop Color Word)  during the luteal phase. In both groups the stimulation by Stroop C-W was  present for systolic blood pressure (SBP) (F = 18.14, p = 0.000), diastolic  blood pressure (DBP) (F = 9.56, p = 0.000), and heart rate (F = 12.80, p =  0.000). Moreover, an interaction of response by group was present for DBP (2.58,  p = 0.04); DBP values were higher in MRD subjects. Also baseline DBP values were  higher in MRD with respect to controls. Area under the curve (AUC) subtracted  from baseline for the SBP, DBP and heart rate did not differ between groups. In  conclusion, MRD subjects facing a cognitive stress had normal cardiovascular  response. However, patients had increased arousal of cardiovascular measures  before and after testing. The significant differences during stress of testing  were dissociated from those of experimental stress stimulation. MRD subjects may  have less ability to cope with novelty than healthy volunteers.  DOI: 10.1177/0333102497017S2001 PMID: 9496769 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Magiakou MA(1), Mastorakos G, Webster E, Chrousos GP.  Author information: (1)Second Department of Pediatrics, P & A Kyriakou Children's Hospital, Athens,  Greece.  The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the female reproductive system  are intertwined and exhibit a complex relationship. Thus, the HPA axis exerts  profound, mostly inhibitory effects, on the reproductive axis, with  corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and CRH-induced propiomelanocortin  peptides inhibiting hypothalamic GnRH secretion, and with glucocorticoids  inhibiting pituitary LH and ovarian estrogen and progesterone secretion and  rendering estrogen-target tissues, such as the endometrium, resistant to the  gonadal steroid. These effects of the HPA axis are responsible for the  ""hypothalamic"" amenorrhea of stress, depression and eating disorders, and the  hypogonadism of Cushing's syndrome. Conversely, estrogen directly stimulates the  CRH gene, which may explain the slight hypercortisolism of females and the  preponderance of depressive, anxiety, and eating disorders, as well as Cushing's  disease in women. Interestingly, several components of the HPA axis and their  receptors are present in reproductive tissues, as autocoid regulators of their  various functions. These include ovarian and endometrial CRH, which may  participate in the inflammatory processes of the ovary, that is, ovulation and  luteolysis, and of the endometrium, that is, implantation and menstruation.  Finally, the hypercortisolism of the latter half of pregnancy can be explained  by high levels of placenta CRH in plasma. This hypercortisolism causes a  transient adrenal suppression in the postpartum period, which may explain the  postpartum blues/depression and autoimmune phenomena of this period.

Bromberger JT(1), Matthews KA, Kuller LH, Wing RR, Meilahn EN, Plantinga P.  Author information: (1)Graduate School of Public Health, University of Pittsburgh, PA, USA.  The authors prospectively studied the effect of demographic, reproductive,  stress-related, and health behavior factors measured at study entry on age of  natural menopause in 185 healthy US women. At study entry, women were 42.5-47.5  years old and premenopausal. After a baseline examination (1983-1985), women  were followed for 7-9 years, during which time they reported on a monthly basis  their menstrual status and whether they were taking hormones. Menopausal age was  defined as age at the last menstrual period prior to stopping menstruation for  12 months (and not taking hormones). Estimated median age at menopause was 51.5  years for the whole sample. Median age at menopause was earlier for women who  reported irregular menstrual cycles at study entry (50.2 years), were  African-American (49.3 years), were smokers (50.6 years), or were currently on a  weight reduction diet (50.5 years). Psychosocial stress was predictive of an  even earlier median age at menopause in African Americans (48.4 years) and in  those with irregular cycles at baseline (49.4 years). Results suggest that  premenopausal women in their forties who are experiencing irregular menstrual  cycles, are smokers, are dieting, or are African-American are likely to reach  menopause earlier than their contemporaries. African-American women may have a  different ""biological clock"" than white women, especially when under stress, or  they may experience more stress of longer duration.

12320444,"NFP offers user-control, but requires discipline. Contraceptive update.",Barnett B,"1. Netw Res Triangle Park N C. 1996 Fall;17(1):17-20.  NFP offers user-control, but requires discipline. Contraceptive update.  Barnett B.  PIP: Natural family planning (NFP) is a low-cost, user-controlled contraceptive  method void of side effects. Couples who choose to rely on NFP must recognize  normal physiological changes (e.g., a rise in the woman's temperature and  changes in the consistency of the cervical mucus) indicating ovulation so as to  avoid sexual intercourse during the fertile period. Couples must be motivated to  use NFP if they wish to prevent pregnancy. Physical or emotional factors can  alter the signs used to predict fertility, however. They and other factors can  reduce NFP's effectiveness. The pregnancy rate is 3% for perfect use of NFP and  20% for typical use. Training in identifying fertility signs and counseling  concerning the need for sexual abstinence during the fertile period improve  NFP's contraceptive effectiveness. Many physicians do not recommend NFP. About  14% of women worldwide use some form of periodic abstinence. Concerns about NFP  include its efficacy under typical-use conditions, particularly when compared  with other contraceptive methods; the need for participation and cooperation of  both partners; difficulty in using NFP if women have factors that affect  fertility symptoms (irregular menses, infections, lack of sleep, alcohol use,  emotional stress, and use of some drugs); and no protection against sexually  transmitted diseases. There has been the question of whether NFP increases the  risk of spontaneous abortion, since some studies have found an association  between spontaneous abortion and sperm or eggs that have been in the  reproductive tract for a prolonged period and are at the end of their life span.  Recent studies do not indicate an association between NFP and spontaneous  abortion, however. Effective NFP training takes about 3 months. Non-medical  personnel can effectively teach NFP. In a European study, many women using NFP  use a barrier method during the fertile period. New technologies and ways of  identifying fertility signs are being developed. Ovulation detection kits tend  to revolve around measuring the body temperature or the levels of luteinizing  hormone or other hormones in urine.  PMID: 12320444 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Sexual assault history and women's reproductive and sexual health.  Golding JM.  Associations of sexual assault history with reproductive and sexual symptoms  were evaluated in 3419 women randomly selected from two communities. Sexual  assault was associated with excessive menstrual bleeding, genital burning, and  painful intercourse (whether or not attributable to disease or injury),  medically explained missing two menstrual periods, and medically unexplained  dysmenorrhea, menstrual irregularity, and lack of sexual pleasure. Physically  violent assaults and those committed by strangers were most strongly related to  reproductive symptoms. Multiple assaults, assaults accomplished by persuasion,  spouse assault, and completed intercourse were most strongly related to sexual  symptoms. Assault was occasionally associated more strongly with reproductive  symptoms among women with lower income or less education, possibly because of  economic stress or differences in assault circumstances. Associations with  unexplained menstrual irregularity were strongest among African American women;  ethnic differences in reported circumstances of assault appeared to account for  these differences. Assault was associated with sexual indifference only among  Latinas.  DOI: 10.1111/j.1471-6402.1996.tb00667.x PMID: 12296010 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

The Authors have studied the effects of different surgical interventions on some  factors of humoral and cell-mediated immuno-competence: 112 premenopausal women,  operated on mainly for benign conditions, have been considered in order to  evaluate the influence of various phases of menstrual cycle on surgical  immunosuppression. Two schemes were used to stratify the study sample: in the  first analysis, we have subdivided the patients in 59 cases in perimenstrual  phase (0 through 6 and 21 through 36 days from last menstrual period, LMP) and  53 in periovulatory (7-20 days from LMP). The second stratification relied on  the hormone-dependent phases determined by the putative time of ovulation 14  days after LMP: 51 cases in follicular phase and 61 cases in luteal phase have  been considered. Immune parameters have been evaluated before surgery and the  day after intervention. The first comparison stresses the worst outcome of  immune parameters in patients operated on in the perimenstrual period (CD4,  activated lymphocytes and C3 have significantly reduced post-operatively). The  second part of the study shows no significant difference in the two groups as to  such parametres.  PMID: 7478085 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Bone health and prevention of osteoporosis in active and athletic women.  Snow-Harter CM(1).  Author information: (1)Department of Exercise and Sport Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis.  Most studies have found lower bone mass among women with exercise-induced  oligomenorrhea compared with eumenorrheic control women and athletes. These  findings have important implications regarding increased risk of both stress  fractures and premature osteoporosis. Active and athletic women should be  encouraged to keep accurate records of their menstrual cycles. Any divergence  from normal should be noted and carefully followed. Bone mass evaluation by bone  densitometry for women with continued irregularities will allow assessment of  skeletal status. Recommendations for treatment can be based, in part, upon these  results, and follow-up scans will offer information on treatment efficacy. For  athletes experiencing loss of periods accompanied by low bone mass, a decrease  in training intensity and volume and an increase in total calories and calcium  intake (1200 to 1500 mg/day) may be indicated. The dietary alterations could be  accomplished by adding three glasses of skim milk per day to the diet. A program  of resistance training designed to increase both muscle strength and mass may  improve the skeletal profile of these athletes as well as protect against soft  tissue injuries. Finally, estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) may be indicated  for those women who are not willing to make changes in their exercise or dietary  patterns. Although there are currently no controlled trials that examine the  efficacy of ERT for treating these athletes, it is generally accepted that the  doses prescribed to postmenopausal women are adequate for reducing bone loss  among amenorrheic athletes. It is important that these women be followed with  bone mass and serum measurements in order to evaluate the efficacy of the  replacement therapy.  PMID: 8013040 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy: a 5-year prospective study.  Panayiotopoulos CP(1), Obeid T, Tahan AR.  Author information: (1)St. Thomas' Hospital, London, England.  We made a long term prospective study of 66 patients with juvenile myoclonic  epilepsy (JME). Prevalence was 10.2% among 672 patients with epilepsies. Sex  distribution was equal. Sixty-three were not diagnosed on referral; JME was not  initially recognized in the epilepsy clinic in 22. Clinical typical absence  seizures were reported in 33.3%, myoclonic jerks in 97% and generalized  tonic-clonic seizures (GTC) in 78.8% of the patients. Mean age (+/- SD) at onset  was 10.5 +/- 3.4 years (range 5-16 years) for absence seizures, 15 +/- 3.5 years  (range 8-26 years) for myoclonic jerks, and 16 +/- 3.5 years (9-28) years (range  1-9 years) and GTC by 4.4 +/- 2.7 years (range 1-8 years) in 14 (21.2%) patients  who manifested all three types of seizure. Absence were never antedated by  myoclonic jerks or GTC. Myoclonic jerks occurred on awakening in 87.5% of the  patients. GTC occurred mainly on awakening, but other patients had nocturnal or  diurnal GTC with no circadian distribution. Neurologic examination was normal  for all patients except for tremor of the hands similar to essential tremor,  noted in 35% of patients. Computed tomography (CT) brain scans were normal: 93%  of patients had precipitating factors: sleep deprivation (89.5%), fatigue  (73.7%), photosensitivity (36.8%; television and video games 8.8%), menstruation  (24.1% of women), mental concentration (22.8%), and stress (12.3%). Incidence of  JME among siblings (13 of 41 examined families) implies an autosomal recessive  mode of inheritance for this Arab population. EEGs were frequently normal in  treated patients. At least one abnormal EEG was recorded in 56 (84.9%) patients.  Abnormalities consisted mainly of generalized discharges of spike/double spike  and/or polyspike and slow wave. Frequent multiple spikes and discharge  fragmentations varied from 0.5- to 20-s duration (mean 6.8 s). Twenty (30.3%)  had focal abnormalities, and 18 (27.3%) had photoconvulsive discharges.  Eighty-eight percent of patients remained seizure-free for > or = 3 years of  follow-up. Effective treatment was achieved with valproate (VPA); control of  myoclonic jerks was improved with clonazepam (CZP). CZP monotherapy did not  consistently prevent GTC. Adding small doses of CZP with simultaneous reduction  of VPA was the most effective and better tolerated form of medication,  particularly in patients demonstrating an adverse reaction or requiring a large  VPA dosage. VPA dosage was successfully reduced in 15 patients who were  seizure-free for > 2 years and had infrequent seizures before treatment, but 9  of 11 patients relapsed after VPA discontinuation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400  WORDS)  DOI: 10.1111/j.1528-1157.1994.tb02432.x PMID: 8156946 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Saketos M(1), Sharma N, Santoro NF.  Author information: (1)New Jersey Medical School, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Newark  07103.  To determine whether cortisol has an effect on hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal  function, we studied 11 eumenorrheic women in the early follicular phase of  consecutive menstrual cycles by performing daytime 10-min blood sampling, one  before and one during hydrocortisone administration. Daily blood sampling for  gonadotropins and sex steroids was also performed. LH pulsations were determined  by modification of a widely used threshold method and compared by paired  t-testing. The LH interpulse interval was significantly prolonged (95 +/- 5 to  119 +/- 14 min; p = 0.001), and the mean LH pulse amplitude remained unchanged  (1.3 +/- 0.1 and 1.5 +/- 0.2 mIU/ml) with glucocorticoid exposure. Mean  estradiol was not altered (46 +/- 5 and 43 +/- 3 pg/ml), but mean LH and FSH  from pooled serum aliquots were slightly but significantly reduced (2.6 +/- 0.2  to 2.2 +/- 0.2, 5.5 +/- 0.4 to 4.5 +/- 0.3 mIU/ml; p = 0.004, 0.012,  respectively). Mean progesterone levels were also decreased (0.8 +/- 0.3 to 0.5  +/- 0.2 ng/ml; p = 0.011) in the presence of exogenous glucocorticoid.  Twenty-four-hour urinary free cortisol levels confirmed a substantial increase  in free cortisol excretion (74 +/- 10 to 305 +/- 50 micrograms/day; p = 0.001).  These results demonstrate that cortisol can slow LH pulse frequency and, by  inference, hypothalamic GnRH secretion, in a manner that appears independent of  corticotropin releasing factor.

Groër M(1), Carr J, Younger MS.  Author information: (1)College of Nursing, University of Tennessee, Knoxville.  This study examined the relationships between symptoms of common infectious  illnesses, menstrual cycle phase, and cycle-related distress. Sixty-five women  who had regular menstrual cycles and were not taking birth control pills were  the convenience sample for this research. Subjects completed the Menstrual  Distress Questionnaire (MDQ), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and an  investigator-developed symptom checklist (SCL) that inventoried symptoms of  common respiratory, skin, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary infections. The  subjects completed all questionnaires three times during the menstrual cycle  (during menstruation, midcycle, and premenstruum). The results of the study  indicated a highly significant clustering of infectious illness symptoms during  the perimenstrual period compared with midcycle. There were significant  relationships between scores on the MDQ and PSS and the frequency and intensity  of infection symptoms throughout the cycle. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) of  the effects of phase, PSS, MDQ, and SCL scores revealed that phasic influences  were not significant when MDQ scores were controlled. PSS and MDQ scores  significantly influenced symptom scores when phase was controlled, suggesting a  general relationship between distress and infectious symptoms during the  menstrual cycle.

Aetiological approach of female reproductive physiology in lactational  amenorrhoea.  Rosetta L(1).  Author information: (1)Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, France.  PIP: The duration of postpartum amenorrhea and return of ovulation varies on an  individual and population basis. In 1980, in Senegal, the relationship of  chronic malnutrition and female fertility was investigated for 2 years. The  stability of the female body regarding weight and arm circumference despite a  heavy annual workload was a surprising finding. The mean female body mass index  was higher for lactating women in amenorrhea than required for restoring  menstruation in European women. The mean duration of postpartum amenorrhea was  18.2 +or- .6 months. The difference between those who resumed menstruation (20.9  +or- .9 months) and who still had amenorrhea (25.4 +or- 2.2 months) was  significant. The duration of breast feeding determined the duration of  amenorrhea. Studies have found a link between ovarian dysfunction and women in  harsh third world environments and sportswomen under intensive training with  both showing irregular menstruation and amenorrhea. Long duration of cycles in  New Guinean women, high amount of anovulation in Zairian forest women, and  suppression of testosterone and estradiol levels in hunter-gatherers were found.  In affluent Europeans and urbanized women in developing countries postpartum  amenorrhea dropped drastically. Long distance runners are often vegetarians with  low calorie consumption and with a high degree of menstrual trouble owing to low  body fat and weight-for-height. The role of beta-endorphins in the hypothalamic  blockade of the gonadotropin releasing hormone pulse generator and high stress  or physical training is proven. The functioning of the  hypothalamo-pituitary-ovarian axis can be hurt by intensive training. Short-term  fasting also suppressed the pulsatile luteinizing hormone and testosterone  secretion. The protocol and methodology of an etiological study is outlined  regarding the factors of this hypothesis on amenorrhea.  DOI: 10.1017/s0021932000019866 PMID: 1634559 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Age at menarche and associated nutritional status variables in Karimui and  Daribi census divisions of Simbu Province.  Groos AD(1), Smith TA.  Author information: (1)Papua New Guinea Institute of Medical Research, Madang.  Age at menarche was estimated from data on 310 girls and young women living in  Karimui and Daribi census divisions of Simbu Province in 1987. The area has high  malnutrition rates among children under five years of age and short adult female  stature suggesting that onset of menses should be late. However, other work has  shown young ages at the birth of first children and high overall fertility rates  among women. The prediction of age at menarche from adult female height is not  valid for this population; the actual age at which 50% of girls had commenced  menstruating is approximately one and a half years earlier, at 15.8 years, than  the predicted age. The nutritional status variables investigated and found to be  associated with the age at menarche are height, weight and triceps skinfold  thickness. At any given age girls whose nutritional status was better,  particularly in terms of weight, were more likely to have commenced  menstruation. Menarche appears to be followed closely by onset of reproductive  function, with the age at the birth of first children estimated at 17.2 years. A  consequence of early entry into reproduction, particularly for girls in areas  where undernutrition is common, is a period of considerable nutritional stress  during adolescence. Intervention programs should consider this and target these  groups for additional health, family planning and nutritional advice.  PMID: 1509816 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"
1514009,[Natural methods of contraception].,"Philippe HJ, Jamin O, Martin MT","1. Rev Infirm. 1992 May;42(9):58-60.  [Natural methods of contraception].  [Article in French]  Philippe HJ, Jamin O, Martin MT.  PIP: The use of natural contraceptive methods, which require avoidance of sexual  relations during the fertile period, declined with development of effective  modern methods. At present, their practice is most appropriate for women with  vascular, metabolic, or other pathology contraindicating use of modern methods  and for couples in which the male partner is fully involved in contraception.  Contraceptive methods should be simple, effective, reversible, and safe. The 2  principle methods in France are hormonal contraceptives, used by 50% of couples,  and IUDs, used by 30%. Hormonal contraceptives, primarily oral contraceptives  (OCs), have a Pearl index of .16% and satisfactory reversibility, but their  metabolic and vascular effects make them inappropriate for some women. The Pearl  index for IUDs is 1-2%. IUD users have a higher risk for tubal infertility, and  some other possible complications are very serious. Neither OCs nor IUDs are  indicated for young girls, perimenopausal women, or postpartum women. The main  shortcoming of the natural methods is their failure rate, which is probably  related to insufficient instruction in their techniques or to forgetting that  they require cooperation of both spouses. The Ogino-Knaus or calendar rhythm  method involves calculating the fertile period taking into account the life  expectancy of the gametes. Calculation is based on the study of the duration of  the menstrual cycle in the preceding year. The Pearl index has been estimated at  1-47%, depending on the regularity of the cycle. The temperature method is based  on modifications of body temperature due to hormonal variations. The fertile  period is considered to begin with the 1st day of menstruation and to last for 3  days following the thermal shift. The Pearl index is 12.2%. Disadvantages of the  method are problems of interpretation related to physical exertion or stress and  the need for a long period of abstinence. The method of palpation of the cervix  is based on detecting the cervical modifications caused by hormonal variations.  Estrogens cause softening, opening, and ascension of the cervix, while  progesterone causes descent and hardening. Palpation of the cervix allows  identification of the fertile period. No Pearl index has been published. The  main problems are difficulty in nulliparas and the risk of infection. The  Billings method is based on modifications of the cervical mucus during the  cycle. The Pearl index is 3%. The principal disadvantages are the difficulty of  interpretation and the time required for learning the method. The symptothermal  method combines analysis of the periovulatory signs with the taking of the body  temperature. The Pearl .8%. The main shortcoming is the possibility of  contradictory signs.

Data from Samoa.  Fitzgerald MH(1).  Author information: (1)Pacific Basin Rehabilitation Research and Training Center, John A. Burns  School of Medicine, University of Hawaii, Manoa, Honolulu.  Data from a Samoan menstruation study suggest that lactation, even intensive  on-demand lactation, does not inhibit menstruation or conception. This paper  explores the applied and theoretical implications of continuing to accept  lactation as a universally effective fertility control mechanism. Such thinking  can have disastrous implications for family planning programs, and it keeps us  from challenging long-held assumptions about lactation's role in population  growth in early populations.  PIP: An anthropologist analyzed 1986-87 data on lactating women from a rural  village in western American Samoa to examine the link between lactation and  ovulation suppression among non-Western, healthy, and robust populations. Most  mothers practiced on demand exclusive breast feeding 24 hours/day for 4-5  months. Yet 75-80% resumed menses before the infant reached 3 months. A  maternity nurse claimed that resumption of menses occurred in most mothers after  1 month and some women even deliver 2 infants in 1 year. The shortest postpartum  amenorrheic period was 3 weeks and the longest was 14 months. Mean family size  stood at 7.8. Birth intervals ranged from 1 to 3 years. These results indicated  that the breast-feeding practices of these women were intensive enough to  produce enough prolactin to suppress ovulation and suppress menstruation, but  they did not do so. Apparently lactation was an ineffective contraceptive among  these women. It is pointed out that considerable research shows lactation to be  effective in malnourished women or those with low fat stores. yet these women  ate the traditional high fat and nutritious diet. She stressed the need to  reconsider the belief that lactation is a universally effective fertility  control mechanism. She also emphasized the necessity to reeducate family  planning workers that breast feeding does not necessarily suppress ovulation,  especially in healthy and robust populations. These results have important  implications for population growth and fertility control in modern as well as  early population.

Q J Med. 1991 Nov;81(295):891-906.  Endocrine function, psychiatric and clinical consequences in patients with  macroprolactinomas after long-term treatment with the new non-ergot dopamine  agonist CV205-502.  Barnett PS(1), Palazidou E, Miell JP, Coskeran PB, Butler J, Dawson JM, Maccabe  J, McGregor AM.  Author information: (1)Department of Medicine, King's College School of Medicine and Dentistry,  London.  Although bromocriptine is the mainstay of treatment of macroprolactinomas, its  therapeutic usefulness may be limited by poor tolerance, lack of consistent  reduction in serum prolactin levels and tumour size, and the necessity for  multiple dosing. Consequently new dopamine agonists have been developed,  including the long acting non-ergot agonist CV205-502 which has been shown to  date to be consistently effective in reducing serum PRL levels and causing  tumour shrinkage. Twelve patients were treated for periods of up to 24 months  with CV205-502 in doses ranging from 0.075 mg to 1.65 mg once daily. Clinical  and psychiatric assessments, biochemical parameters, tumour size determination,  and anterior pituitary function tests were performed regularly. Tumour shrinkage  was noted in all patients, and varied from 11 per cent reduction to complete  disappearance of tumour. Prolactin levels became normal in seven patients and  were reduced by more than 90 per cent in the remaining five. Normal menstruation  resumed in six of the eight women, one of whom conceived after one year of  therapy; libido returned in all patients. Psychiatric complications occurred in  three patients necessitating withdrawal of therapy in one. Significant weight  loss was noted in 11 of 12 patients. Triglyceride concentrations fell from 1.5  +/- 0.1 to 1.0 +/- 0.1 mmol/l at 12 months (p = 0.006), and cholesterol fell  from 6.3 +/- 0.4 to 5.3 +/- 0.3 mmol/l (p = 0.04). The mean TSH response 20 min  following TRH injection fell from 14.3 +/- 2.9 to 8.7 +/- 1.3 mU/l at 2 months  (p = 0.027). There was a significant increase in the peak growth hormone  response to the insulin stress test from basal median (25th-75th centiles)  values of 15 (4.4-25.5) mU/l to 24.5 (9-37) mU/l at 2 months (p less than 0.01)  and 31 (19.3-63.5) at 12 months (p less than 0.005). CV205-502 is highly  effective in the medical management of patients with macroprolactinomas,  reducing prolactin levels and tumour size and restoring normal anterior  pituitary function. It is, however, associated with the important side effects  of weight loss and psychiatric complications which should be drawn to the  attention of clinicians.  PMID: 1687293 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"
2224376,Factors related to self-reporting of the pre-menstrual syndrome.,"Warner P, Bancroft J","1. Br J Psychiatry. 1990 Aug;157:249-60. doi: 10.1192/bjp.157.2.249.  Factors related to self-reporting of the pre-menstrual syndrome.  Warner P(1), Bancroft J.  Author information: (1)MRC Reproductive Biology Unit, Edinburgh.  Menstrual health questionnaires were completed by a self-selected sample of the  readership of a woman's magazine (n = 5457). Sixty-one per cent of subjects  described themselves as suffering from pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS) and this was  largely corroborated by ratings of symptoms pre-menstrually, menstrually and  post-menstrually for the most recent cycle. Mood symptoms were more strongly  implicated than physical ones. Self-report of PMS was found to be modestly  associated with aspects of parity and oral contraceptive use, but strongly and  positively related to the duration of 'natural' menstrual cycles (i.e.  uninterrupted by pregnancy or steroidal contraception) and to psychosocial  stress. There were interactions among psychosocial factors and between  psychosocial load and duration of natural cycles.  PIP: Studies of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) have identified so many systems and  associated factors that it is difficult to assess whether PMS is a discrete  entity or encompasses a variety of cyclical phenomenon with differing  etiologies. A heuristic, retrospective study of PMS was conducted among 5457  readers of a UK women's magazine who mailed in a menstrual health questionnaire  that focused on the most recent menstrual period. 61% of respondents indicated  that they were currently suffering from PMS, 32% were uncertain, and 7% did not  experience PMS. Mood symptoms, reported by 65%, included irritability (65%),  anger for no apparent reason (64%), and easily upset (60%). Of the physical  symptoms, the most prevalent were abdominal bloating (45%) and breast tenderness  (40%). There was a remission of mood and physical disturbances postmenstrually  in 79% and 94% of sufferers, respectively. Oral contraceptive (OC) users were  significantly less likely to report PMS than nonusers, especially nulliparous  users. In addition, there was a generally trend for PMS to increase in  prevalence with increasing age. More significant was the finding that, the  longer a woman has been experiencing menstrual cycles uninterrupted by pregnancy  or unmodified by OC use, the more likely she is to self-report PMS. After 6  years of natural cycles, there was a higher prevalence of PMS among women with a  high psychosocial stress level. In women with no psychosocial ""load,"" PMS is  most prevalent in nulliparous women and after 2 years of natural cycles. These  findings suggest that PMS may persist as a result of biological sensitivity to  premenstrual changes, possibly interacting with psychosocial factors. Further  research will focus on measures of the severity of PMS clinical symptoms and  patterns of symptom change.  DOI: 10.1192/bjp.157.2.249 PMID: 2224376 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

[Psychosocial effects of the onset of menopause and physical symptoms in early  postmenopause].  [Article in German]  Baum E(1).  Author information: (1)Lehrauftrag Allgemeinmedizin der Philipps-Universität Marburg.  57 women were studied who were GMP patients, whose spontaneous menopause had  occurred 6 to 36 months ago and who did not take any sexual hormones. Purpose of  the study was to determine psychosocial influences on the time of onset of the  menopause and on climacteric complaints. It was found that the overall  impairment by hot flushes and pain in the limbs during this phase of life was  largely independent of the studied parameters. With regard to the time of onset  of the menopause there was a trend to an linear relationship between the factor  ""social dependence"" and the age at which menopause occurred, as well as a link  between that age and period intervals 5 years before cessation of menstrual  bleeding. An enhanced tendency to exhaustion representing a nonspecific  menopause syndrome was found particularly often in women who were highly  ""socially dependent"". There was no relationship between climacteric complaints  on the one hand and, on the other hand, experiences of loss, social stress and  relief factors, partnership relations, experiences of menarche, menstruation and  menopause as well as basic feeling tone; however, a depressive tone, as defined  by the Giessen test, was clearly predominant in the examined population. It is  concluded from these results that flushes in the early postmenopausal phase are  mostly a biological phenomenon, whereas vegetative concomitant complaints are  markedly dependent on psychosocial factors that correspond to a typically  ""feminine"" role enactment as postulated by social convention.

Author information: (1)Parkview Clinic, Wellington Hospital.  This study is an extension of a previous study on oral contraceptive pill method  failure in reliable pill takers. It documents 137 cases which presented during  the 3 year period from December 1985 to December 1988. The most important new  finding is that smoking is a significant risk factor in failure on the combined  pill (67% were smokers, n = 118), but not on the progestagen-only pill, although  the numbers in the latter group were small (n = 19). Diarrhoea and/or vomiting  (46%) and drug interactions (33%) are confirmed as important predisposing  factors. Systemic illness and/or severe psychological stress may also affect  pill utilisation and such factors were found in 47%. Menstrual disturbances were  found in 32% of women on the combined pill and 68% of these were smokers.  Multiple factors were present in most cases (79%). Repeat failures occurred in  25%.  PIP: A questionnaire was administered to the 137 women who presented to  Wellington Hospital from December 1985-December 1988 for termination of  pregnancy due to method failure while using oral contraceptives (OCs).  Specifically investigated was the presence in these women of risk factors such  as menstrual disturbances, cigarette smoking, diarrhea, vomiting, and  interactions with other drugs. 118 of the pregnancies involved users of combined  OCs; the remaining 19 women were using a progestogen-only pill. As in previous  studies, diarrhea and/or vomiting emerged as the most significant factor in OC  failure (46% of the 137 cases in this series). In an additional 34% of cases, OC  failure was linked to the intake of various other medications (e.g.,  antibiotics) believed to interfere with OC utilization. 32% of the combined OC  users with an unintended pregnancy reported menstrual disturbances such as  irregular bleeding, breakthrough bleeding, or amenorrhea. Of interest was the  finding that 68% of the subjects with menstrual disturbances were smokers. In  addition, 67% of the women in the combined OC group who experienced method  failure were cigarette smokers, a figure that is 20% than would be expected  based on an analysis of census data on female smoking. Among users of  progestogen-only Ocs, there were no significant association with menstrual  disturbances and/or smoking with method failure; however, the sample size was  small (19 women). Systemic illnesses and/or psychological stress were present in  47% of the women in this series. Multiple risk factors were present in 79% of  the cases analyzed. 25% of subjects had experienced previous method failure with  OCs.  PMID: 2812591 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Heilbrun AB Jr(1), Frank ME.  Author information: (1)Department of Psychology, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322.  This study considered whether general stress level and self-preoccupation  sensitize women to symptoms of menstrual and premenstrual distress and whether  this effect is more pronounced for premenstrual symptoms. Equal-size categories  of normal college women reporting greater distress during the premenstrual  period (PD), during the menstrual period (MD), or about equally in both periods  were constituted. The PD women demonstrated significantly greater  self-preoccupation than either the MD or equivalent groups; they also reported  higher general stress than either comparison group, although statistical  reliability was not attained. However, when both sensitizing factors were  introduced into the same analysis, high self-preoccupation and a high level of  general stress were found only in the PD group. The present evidence suggests  that stress and personality not only sensitize premenstrual symptoms in PMS  women but are prominent features in normal women who report more serious  symptoms during the premenstrual period.

[The inhibition stage of lipid peroxidation during stress].  [Article in Russian]  Guliaeva NV, Luzina NL, Levshina IP, Kryzhanovskiĭ GN.  Stress is shown to induce at first the generalized inhibition of lipid  peroxidation (LPO), and then the activation of LPO. In brain and blood serum of  rats subjected to continuous footshock as well as to restraint stress LPO  products decreased and superoxide scavenging activity increased during the  initial period of stress, after 1 hour of footshock LPO indices nearly reached  normal values, and after 2 hours of footshock the accumulation of LPO products  and decrease of superoxide scavenging activity were seen. LPO inhibition was  accompanied by accumulation of easy oxidizable brain phospholipids and by  depletion of brain cholesterol, during LPO activation brain cholesterol content  and cholesterol-phospholipid ratio increased. The content of LPO  products--fluorescent Schiff bases in blood plasma of women suffering from  algomenorrhea at first decreased (O-12 h) and then dramatically increased (12-24  h) after a onset of pain at the beginning of menstruation. The data suggest that  the stage of LPO inhibition precedes its activation during stress.  PMID: 3207869 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

None of the other three defences studied (projection, repression, and  denial) was associated with menstrual or premenstrual distress. The adaptive  role of rationalization was explained in terms of coping by confrontation rather  than evasion when the sources of stress tend to be inevitable.

The aim of this study is to elucidate the role of ""beta-endorphin (beta-End) &  beta-lipotropin (beta-LPH)"" on the regulation of gonadotropin (Gn) secretion. We  investigated the relationships between immunoreactive beta-End plus beta-LPH and  Gn in peripheral plasma of normal menstruating women, 1) during periovulatory  period, especially at the time of Gn surge, 2) at the estrogen induced Gn surge  (positive feedback) and 3) at the time of hypoxic stress. Plasma concentrations  of beta-End plus beta-LPH were measured as immunoreactive beta-End (i-beta-End)  by RIA after extraction with Sep-Pak C18. First, we assessed pulsatile Gn  secretions during periovulatory period in 19 normal women every 10 minutes for 4  hours, some women were at the time of Gn surge in its ascending limb, plateau of  the peak, and descending limb of the surge. Meanwhile, circadian variations of  plasma i-beta-End levels of these subjects were assessed at 4 hours' interval on  the same day. In two subjects, on the day before the onset of LH surge,  significantly low (p less than 0.05) basal and peak levels of i-beta-End were  observed, although the basic patterns of circadian rhythm were preserved.  Secondly, changes of plasma i-beta-End levels during estrogen (estradiol  benzoate 1mg i.m.) induced positive feedback tests were evaluated in 16 normal  women and 6 hypothalamic amenorrheic women by daily blood sampling. In normal  subjects, small but significant increases (p less than 0.05) of plasma  i-beta-End were observed when Gn showed initial decreases at 48 hours after  injection. Subsequently at 72 hours, however, plasma i-beta-End decreased  precipitously at the time of Gn surge. On the other hand, in hypothalamic  amenorrheic women who were devoid of Gn surge, no significant changes of plasma  i-beta-End levels were observed. The transient decreases of plasma i-beta-End  just prior to the Gn surge support the idea that i-beta-End exerts tonic  inhibition on the onset of Gn surge and the disappearance of its inhibition  might trigger the positive Gn surge. And it was also suggested that release  mechanisms of both i-beta-End and Gn are impaired in hypothalamic amenorrhea.  Thirdly, in acute hypoxic stress experiment, 5 normal female volunteers were  placed in hypobaric (500 mbar) condition in which oxygen supply is a half of  atmosphere, simultaneous blood samplings of Gn, prolactin and i-beta-End were  performed every 15 minutes for 3 hours.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)  DOI: 10.1507/endocrine1927.63.10_1289 PMID: 2963770 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

[No authors listed]  PIP: Practical tips for using home pregnancy tests, for maximizing the hygienic  effects of spermicides, and for minimizing the risk of toxic shock syndrome  during use of contraceptive sponges are summarized here. All home pregnancy  tests are comparable in accuracy: they differ in cost, type of read out and  clarity of instructions. The most important tips to follow are to read  directions and to wait 10 days after the missed period. It is best to do 2  tests, to visit a physician if the results differ, to continue contraception  even if the first test is negative. Be wary of factors that may influence the  result, such as drug intake, stress, weight loss and athletic training. Toxic  shock syndrome, indicated by fever above 102 degrees Farenheit, brief rash, very  low blood pressure, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain and later by peeling skin on  hands and feet, is not associated unduly with using sponges. Those who have had  toxic shock, or are menstruating, should not use sponges, nor should anyone wear  one for more than 30 hours continuously. Spermicides, whether in foams,  suppositories, creams, films or jellies, help to kill organisms causing sexually  transmitted gonorrhea, Chlamydia, and pelvic infections.

Author information: (1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Wayne State University School of  Medicine, Hutzel Hospital, Detroit, MI 48201, USA.  Endometriosis affects 5-20% of menstruating women and occurs primarily within  the pelvis. Although histologically benign, ectopic endometrial tissue possesses  the ability to grow, infiltrate and disseminate with life threatening  results/consequences. This is illustrated by a case of asymptomatic  endometriosis involving the ureters and rectum. The importance of evaluating the  integrity of the urinary tract in endometriosis, especially cases involving the  uterosacral ligaments, is stressed. Appropriate therapy followed by periodic  surveillance for progression of the disease is discussed.  DOI: 10.1016/0020-7292(86)90040-8 PMID: 20419912 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Harrison W, Sharpe L, Endicott J.  The etiology of premenstrual syndrome is unknown. A wide variety of etiological  explanations has been suggested, but controlled studies based on these theories  have generally failed to provide confirmation. This article reviews the  literature on treatment of premenstrual symptoms and provides some practical  suggestions for clinical management.  PIP: This article reviews the literature on the treatment of premenstrual  symptoms and provides some suggestions for clinical management. Most studies  report moderate to severe premenstrual changes in 20-30% of women. Premenstrual  changes have been variously attributed to hormonal factors, fluid and  electrolyte imbalance, pyridoxine deficiency, abnormal prostaglandin levels,  neuroticism, endorphin imbalance or withdrawal, and fluctuations in monoamine  oxidase levels. Most studies in this area are either uncontrolled or have  serious methodologic flaws. Despite the current absence of knowledge about the  etiology or proven effective treatment of premenstrual syndrome, clinical  experience suggests a number of steps beginning with a complete physical,  gynecologic, and endocrinologic examination. A daily patient diary of symptoms  and their severity, collected over at least 2 full menstrual cycles, can be  helpful to identify changes that are menses-related, repetitive, and have  clearcut symptom-free intervals. Initial therapeutic management consists of  education and support. Women are instructed to keep the premenstrual period as  free of external stress as possible. If further intervention is required, a  symptom-oriented approach targeted at the most prominent symptoms is  recommended. The severity of symptoms and the degree of functional impairment  should be weighed against the risks associated with pharmacologic agents.  Routine use of diuretics is not advised. Psychosocial intervention, stress  reduction, and dietary changes also may be effective. However, no consistently  effective treatment for dysphoric premenstrual symptoms has been identified,  most likely because the syndrome is not a single entity.

Bullen BA, Skrinar GS, Beitins IZ, Carr DB, Reppert SM, Dotson CO, Fencl MD,  Gervino EV, McArthur JW.  A prospective study of the hormonal effects of a moderate exercise training  program (4-wk control, 8-wk training) was conducted in seven young women.  Sixty-minutes continuous bicycle ergometer tests of fixed relative intensity  were performed at the beginning, middle, and end of the training period. The  capacity of these acute bouts of exercise to affect circulating levels of stress  markers, reproductive hormones, and hormones with possible antireproductive  potential was measured. In addition, the urinary excretion of reproductive  hormones was monitored continuously via serial overnight urine collections.  Within testing sessions, plasma concentrations of all stress markers and  antireproductive hormones rose significantly. Across testing sessions, only  beta-endorphin + beta-lipotropin and cortisol exhibited an increment in peak  responses as training progressed. Plasma reproductive hormone levels showed  insignificant acute changes, and cyclic menstruation and preovulatory  gonadotropin surges continued in all subjects. However, ovarian function was  disturbed in four subjects as evidenced by a decreased excretion of estriol,  free progesterone, or both. Transient infertility is a known clinical  accompaniment of hormonal changes of comparable subtlety.  DOI: 10.1152/jappl.1984.56.6.1453 PMID: 6735803 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Psychosocial considerations of the premenstrual syndrome.  Bernsted L, Luggin R, Petersson B.  For many years a possible conjoint physical and psychological cyclicity among  women has been discussed. To date there has been no biological explanation for  psychological cyclicity. Attempts to treat negative psychological symptoms  during the premenstrual phase by pharmacological means have not been  significantly superior to placebo. The psychological viewpoint stresses that the  repetitive confrontation with often conflicting material during the premenstrual  phase must be seen in light of the development and integration of the  personality. This process occurs by identification with the mother, and  premenstrual symptoms can be seen as reflecting problems with feminine  self-acceptance and self-esteem. The attributional explanation where women's  negative but not positive moods are seen as biological could further affect  women's self-esteem. Important scientific problems regarding the study of  cyclical moods and behavior, the description of a baseline, the validity of  self-reports and the soundness and validity of questionnaires often used, remain  unsolved.

6352131,"Exercise, sports, and menstrual dysfunction.",Hale RW,"1. Clin Obstet Gynecol. 1983 Sep;26(3):728-35.  Exercise, sports, and menstrual dysfunction.  Hale RW.  With the increasing involvement of women in exercise programs, the physician is  faced with more and more questions regarding the effect of exercise upon the  reproductive system. Currently, it appears that premenarchal training may have  the effect of delaying the onset of menses in some girls. There is no evidence  that it delays the other stage of puberty or that it causes any harmful  development by this delay. In the postmenarchal woman, strenuous exercise can  definitely alter her bleeding pattern. The usual result is oligomenorrhea  progressing toward amenorrhea as the exercise increases. This is not a universal  phenomenon, however, and other factors such as percentage of body fat, stress,  diet, and energy drain also play a role. The menses will usually resume its  preexercise pattern after a period of rest.  PMID: 6352131 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Individual levels of plasma alpha 2-antiplasmin and alpha 2-macroglobulin during  the normal menstrual cycle and in women on oral contraceptives low in oestrogen.  Jespersen J, Sidelmann J.  Determinations of alpha 2-antiplasmin and alpha 2-macroglobulin were made in  plasma samples collected during one normal or hormone induced cycle in 15 normal  women and 11 women using oral contraceptives containing 30 micrograms ethinyl  oestradiol and 150 micrograms levo-norgestrel. The immediate plasmin inhibition  test for determination of alpha 2-antiplasmin was modified for application on a  centrifugal analyser using the chromogenic peptide substrate Chromozym PL. alpha  2-Macroglobulin concentration was determined by radial-immunodiffusion. There  were no differences between the two groups in the mean concentrations of alpha  2-antiplasmin and alpha 2-macroglobulin, but during the cycle a slight, and  statistically significant fall occurred in the alpha 2-antiplasmin concentration  in both groups, while the fluctuations of alpha 2-macroglobulin were small and  insignificant. Distinctly individual levels of both inhibitors were found to  exist. The variations in these during the periods of the cycle fluctuated within  a much narrower range than the variation of the total average. The results  stress the importance of determining the fluctuations in individual levels in  longitudinal studies. These findings exclude variations in the concentrations of  these inhibitors as possible sources of a change in the antithrombotic potential  caused by oral contraceptives.

Menstrual dysfunction characterized by delayed menarche, irregular menses, or  secondary amenorrhea often affects women who compete in athletics over a  prolonged time. Loss of body fat and emotional stress are important predisposing  factors. Under these circumstances, hypoestrogenism, an altered ratio of  follicle-stimulating hormone to luteinizing hormone, and elevation of serum  testosterone, prolactin, catecholamines, and opioids are fairly common. There is  controversy over whether the working capacity and performance of the average  woman varies appreciably during various phases of the menstrual cycle.  Apparently, those who suffer from premenstrual tension do have a diminution in  working capacity. Generally, the causes of menstrual dysfunction are the same  for athletes and nonathletes, and there are currently no data to forbid  athletes' training at any time during the menses. A gynecologic examination  should be done before menstrual dysfunction is considered to be due to physical  exercise. If this assumption is substantiated, and if amenorrhea persists for  one year or more, a periodic estrogen-progesterone regimen should be offered to  minimize vascular problems, osteoporosis, and stress fractures, and to protect  the endometrium and ovarian function.

12267056,Menstrual blood loss (MBL) in nulliparous Kenyan women.,"Wanjohi JK, Sekadde-kigondu CB, Maina FW, Mati JK","1. J Obstet Gynaecol East Cent Africa. 1983 Mar;2(1):23-6.  Menstrual blood loss (MBL) in nulliparous Kenyan women.  Wanjohi JK, Sekadde-kigondu CB, Maina FW, Mati JK.  PIP: Menstrual blood loss (MBL) was evaluated in 74 nulliporous Kenyan women  aged between 20 and 27 years. The hemoglobin levels were all in normal range  with the mean of 13.65 +or- 0.8, 13.84 +or- 1.2 and 13.04 +or- 1.2 g/100 ml  respectively in 3 populations. The MBL was comparable in the 3 populations with  the mean of 35.1 +or- 12.6, 30.6 +or- 8.7 and 32.2 +or- 9.4 ml respectively.  There was no difference of statistical significance between the 2 periods  studied per each individual. This study objectively assesses the menstrual blood  loss in 3 population groups--2 urban and 1 rural. The data can be used to  evaluate menstrual blood loss before and after initiation of various  contraceptives used in Kenya. Subjects were volunteers who were not on any  contraception except barrier or natural rhythm methods, not under psychological  stress and who exhibited normal physical female characteristics on examination.  Those who wished to drop out, became pregnant or desired contraception, were  excluded. The study confirms the individual constancy of the menstrual blood  loss in this population. This has important practical implications since a  single determination of the menstrual blood loss may be a fairly good expression  for the average blood loss in a woman. The immediate effect of various  treatments such as IUD insertion or oral contraceptives on the MBL may easily be  evaluated quantitatively by measurements in consecutive periods using only 1  period as a control. The quick method can be easily used in evaluating  pathological conditions e.g. iron-deficiency due to heavy bleeding,  IUD-associated hemorrhage, menorrhagia and uterine fibroid.

6573085,Cytologic atypias in the uterine fluid of intrauterine contraceptive device users.,"Kobayashi TK, Casslén B, Stormby N","1. Acta Cytol. 1983 Mar-Apr;27(2):138-41.  Cytologic atypias in the uterine fluid of intrauterine contraceptive device  users.  Kobayashi TK, Casslén B, Stormby N.  A peculiar cell pattern, characterized as an atypical glandular cell cluster  (AGCC), was found in the uterine fluid from women using intrauterine  contraceptive devices (IUDs). This atypia can mimic adenocarcinoma. Since the  atypical cells were present in much higher frequency in the uterine fluid than  in the cervical mucus, it is suggested that they originated in the endometrium.  PIP: In a current research program on intrauterine cytology, an effort was  undertaken to describe and quantitate the atypical glandular cell cluster (AGCC)  observed in uterine fluid from IUD users. Uterine fluid was sampled and  cervicovaginal smears taken from 54 healthy women of reproductive age with  regular menstrual periods. 34 of the patients had used an IUD (TCu 200, Recip,  Sweden) for 1-1/2 to 3 years. 20 patients did not use IUDs or oral  contraceptives (OCs). Within each group, samples were taken in the proliferative  phase (8th-16th day of the cycle) and in the luteal phase (17th-30th day of the  cycle). The uterine fluid was aspirated with a sterile pediatric feeding tube. A  low aspiration vacuum minimized the trauma to the endometrial mucosa, and thus a  blood free sample could be obtained. Papanicolaou, AGCCs were counted on both  slides, and the sum was given as the number/mcl. The number of inflammatory  cells/mcl of uterine fluid was also calculated for each sample. AGCCs were  present in the uterine fluid smears from 22 of the 34 IUD users. They occurred  similarly in the proliferative and luteal phases. In these 22 samples, a mean of  5.1 clusters/mcl was found. Each cluster consisted of 3-40 cells; the individual  cells varied morphologically but were generally characterized by enlarged  nuclei, with coarsely granular, irregularly distributed chromatin, occasionally  a marked nuclear border, and conspicuous nucleoli. Some cells even revealed  marked clumping of the chromatin and macronucleoli. It is thus understandable  that these cells can mimic endometrial adenocarcinoma. This was further stressed  by the inconstant presence of cytoplasmic vacuoles and signet ring cells. In  May-Grunwald-Giemsa stained smears, many mononuclear cells revealed a  considerable amount of reddish brown pigmentation, with granules about 1 mcm-2  mcm in diameter in thenucleus as well as in the cytoplasm. In the distinct  macrophages, this finding was less common. The granules were not easily seen in  Papanicolaou stained specimens. AGCCs were absent in all but 1 of the samples in  the control group. Normal endometrial cells were found in all the other samples.  ACGGs were present in the cervicovaginal smears from 2 of the 34 IUD users.  AGCCs were also found in the uterine fluid from these 2 patients. AGCCs were not  present in any of the 20 cervicovaginal smears from the control group. The data  strongly suggest an endometrial origin for the AGCCs since they were found much  more frequently in the uterine fluid than in the cervical mucus.  PMID: 6573085 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Toxic shock syndrome associated with a contraceptive diaphragm.  DeYoung P, Martyn J, Wass H, Harth L, Crichton E, Reynolds C.  PIP: A case report is presented of toxic shock syndrome associated with the use  of a contraceptive diaphragm and recent removal of an IUD. A 23 year old woman  was admitted to St. Paul's Hospital in Vancouver, British Columbia because of  frequent watery diarrhea and vomiting that had begun suddenly 2 days earlier, as  well as generalized abdominal and muscular pain, fever and sweating of 1 day's  duration. The patient's last menstrual period had ended 3 weeks earlier. Oral  contraceptive (OC) therapy had been stopped 9 months earlier, and 2 weeks before  admission an IUD had been removed because of dyspareunia. A diaphragm had been  inserted 24 hours before the onset of symptoms and was in place at the time of  admission. Removal of the diaphragm revealed about 10 ml of greenish yellow pus.  Laboratory tests showed multiorgan involvement. The blood urea nitrogen level  was 35 mg/dl and the serum creatinine level 2.9 mg/dl. The serum amylase level  was 125 IU/l at the time of admission but rose to 1021 IU/l by day 6. The  prothrombin time was 16 seconds. Arterial blood gas studies while the patient  was breathing room air showed the following: pH 7.36, carbon dioxide tension 20  mm Hg and oxygen tension 84 mm Hg. Urinalysis showed pus and a small amount of  glucose. Treatment consisted of blood volume expansion and electrolyte  replacement. The patient showed improvement within 48 hours. 6 days after  admission an exfoliative desquamating rash developed on the volar surfaces of  the fingers and feet, and a slight scaling rash was noted on the face. These  cleared spontaneously, without residual scarring. 6 criteria for the diagnosis  of toxic shock syndrome have been defined: an increased body temperature; skin  manifestations; shock, frequently with orthostatic hypotension and syncope;  involvement of multiple organs; diarrhea; and myalgia. Clinicians need to  appreciate that tampons are not the only cause of toxic shock syndrome and that  the syndrome can occur at times other than during menstruation. Diaphragms may  only rarely be associated, but their relation to toxic shock syndrome must be  recognized. Counseling on the use of diaphragms should stress the avoidance of  prolonged use.

Prevalence of oligomenorrhea and amenorrhea in a college population.  Bachmann GA, Kemmann E.  Menstrual disorders in college students have been reported as higher than in the  general population. Several reasons, among them calorie-restricted diets,  strenuous exercise, and college-related stress, have been attributed to this  increased prevalence. During the period November, 1979, to January, 1980, 991 of  1,420 college students completed questionnaires which inquired about their  menstrual history. The prevalence of oligomenorrhea in this group was 11.3% and  that of amenorrhea was 2.6%. Significant factors associated with oligomenorrhea  or amenorrhea in this group were weight loss (greater than 20 pounds) and  jogging. In most women with oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, menstrual irregularity  was present prior to college entry. With the use of self-administered  questionnaires, we could not identify any specific college stress to account for  the presence of menstrual abnormalities in a college population.

Nesheim BI, Bergsjø P.  The relationship between heavy physical stress and reproductive function in  sportswomen has received comparatively little attention. In some young  sportswomen an onset of menarche which is later than average has been found.  Studies of menstrual rhythm in women who train hard have not given any decisive  answers, but individual observations indicate a certain deficiency of ovarian  function or delay in ovulation. The performance level may be lowered during the  actual period of menstruation, but even here the evidence is poor. Whether or  not modern methods of contraception such as the pill and intra-uterine devices  have any influence on performance is an open question. There is no objective  evidence that training is harmful during pregnancy, or that it causes problems  in labour, neither does the experience of labour appear to influence later  performance.

During the period January, 1978 to June, 1979, a total of 900 college students  was seen in a university student health center. Among these, 14.6% (131/900) had  menstrual disorders. Oligomenorrhea or secondary amenorrhea, the chief complaint  in 72.5% (95/131) students, accounted for 10.6% (95/900) of the total  population. When a selected group of students with oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea was  investigated, most had elevated levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and  normal/low levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) suggestive of polycystic  ovary syndrome (PCO). The significance of these findings in the development of  oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea and PCO under stress is discussed.  PIP: This paper examines the prevalence and types of menstruation disorders  among 900 female students attending the student health service of a large  coeducational university during the period 1/78 to 6/79. Each student was  subjected to a careful history and physical examination as well as counseling  with regard to the physiology of menstrual cycle and possible causes. Laboratory  tests for pituitary, ovarian, thyroid, and adrenal function were performed, and  blood samples were collected and assayed for various hormones. Of the 900  students, 131 (14.6%) complained of menstrual disorders unrelated to oral  contraceptive use. 90 (72.5%) out of the 131 had oligomenorrhea or secondary  amenorrhea and accounted for 10.6% of all women visiting the student health  service. The onset of oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea was not associated with oral  contraceptive use. Based on clinical features and gonadotropin values, 3 groups  of oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea patients were identified: group 1, hypogonadotropic  associated with simple weight loss (n=1); group 2, normagonadotropic of unknown  etiology (n=6); and group 3, elevated luteinizing hormone with normal/low  follicle-stimulating hormone suggestive of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCO)  (n=12). The true incidence of PCO in this series is not known because of the  incomplete endocrine profile of the college students. Stressful events  (physical, emotional, social) and/or the competitive life style at the college  campus may contribute to the incidence of oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea, but  carefully designed prospective studies are needed to substantiate this.

Serum cortisol level in lactating women using Progestasert system.  Askalani H, Badraoui MH, Mahrous T, Osman MI, Bayad MA, Ibrahim II, Abdalla MI.  PIP: This study is designed to reveal any possible change in serum cortisol  levels of lactating mothers, both menstruating and amenorrheic, fitted with a  progestasert intrauterine system immediately postpartum. The subjects of the  study were 46 lactating females, in the 28-35 age group and of parity from 1 to  6. The women were classified into 2 groups: 1) menstruating and lactating  females (n-26), with restored menstruation for at least 3 successive cycles  prior to the study. These women were classified into a control group of 11  normally menstruating mothers not using any type of contraception, 9 mothers  fitted with Cu T-200 IUDs, and 6 mothers fitted with a progestasert IUD. Both  devices were inserted immediately postpartum. The 2nd group comprised  amenorrheic and lactating mothers, delivered 2 months prior to the study, and  classified as Progestasert users (n-8) and Cu T-200 users (n=12). Comparison of  serum cortisol levels in the various categories revealed decreased levels in  both IUD groups as compared to normal controls, at the onset of menstruation.  However, a significant difference was only obtained between the non-IUD and Cu  T-200 groups. Otherwise, no significant differences between the groups were  ovbserved at day M-3. Serum cortisol levels were significantly raised in the  control groups with the onset of menses which could be explained on the basis of  menstrual stress. Serum cortisol levels were also determined in 2 groups of  lactating amenorrheic mothers, 2 months after delivery, fitted with Progestasert  and Cu T-200 IUDs. Results indicate non significant difference between the 2  groups. Based on these findings, it is concluded that the progestasert  intrauterine system has no effect on cortisol levels of postpartum lactating  women.  PMID: 12339476 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Nurs Times. 1980 Jul 10;76(28):1231-2.  The contraceptive effects of lactation. Failure to appreciate these effects  resulted in unnecessary stress for a couple.  Houston MJ, Howie PW, McNeilly AS.  PIP: Lactational infertility is being investigated in mothers who delivered in  the Simpson Memorial Maternity Pavilion in Edinburgh, Scotland. A group of  breast feeding and a group of bottle feeding mothers were monitored. Weekly  urinary total estrogen, pregnanediol excretion, and fortnightly plasma  gonadotropins and prolactin concentrations were measured to determine the  relationship between the resumption of menstruation and 1st postpartum  ovulation. A research sister visited each mother at home every 2 weeks to  collect a 10 ml sample of venous blood and to check on the progress of breast  feeding. Although lactation is not a totally reliable contraceptive method, a  mother is very unlikely to ovulate when she is fully breast feeding in the early  weeks after delivery and particularly if she is giving night-time feeds. When  the timing of 1st ovulation was compared in 7 bottle feeding mothers and 10  breast feeding mothers, ovulation was delayed in all lacting women and returned  only when the mother started to wean her baby. A case history is reported of 1  patient who highlights the need for a deeper understanding of this natural  contraceptive mechanism. The patient was Roman Catholic, mother of 4 children,  and she and her husband wanted to practice only natural methods of  contraception. She was informed that her weekly urinary steroid levels showed no  evidence of ovulation, but she remained unconvinced and requested information  and guidance on cervical mucus assessment. By choosing to stop breast feeding to  return to a familiar contraceptive method, the patient increased the risk of  unwanted conception. A prolonged period of lactation may be an effective method  for couples who want to space their children, and this option should be  explained to couples.  PMID: 6902191 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"
7371198,Effects of oestrogens on erythrocyte enzyme efflux in normal men and women.,"Thomson WH, Smith I","1. Clin Chim Acta. 1980 Apr 25;103(2):203-8. doi: 10.1016/0009-8981(80)90214-4.  Effects of oestrogens on erythrocyte enzyme efflux in normal men and women.  Thomson WH, Smith I.  In the normal female range for serum creatine kinase, the large diminutions  associated with the reproductive period and with pregnancy are apparently  related to oestrogen production. Specimens of heparinised blood from healthy men  and women were stressed by chilling, and showed the predictably large efflux of  erythrocyte aldolase and lactate dehydrogenase into plasma. In aliquots of the  same specimens simultaneously stressed in the same way, previous substitution of  the natural plasma with pregnant plasma rich in oestrogens gave a marked  significant reduction in the efflux of both enzymes in women, but not in men.  The significance of these findings is discussed.  PIP: Based on earlier evidence that intracellular enzymes are retained by  internal arrangement dependent on adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and then escape  into the plasma during depletion, this study attempted to test external  influences, such as hormones, which may also influence intracellular enzyme  retention. 20 healthy adults, (10 men and 10 menstruating women) were studied.  In addition, pregnant plasma was obtained from healthy pregnant women. Blood  specimens from subjects were heparinized and then stressed by chilling; these  specimens showed a large efflux of erythrocyte aldolase and lactate  dehydrogenase into plasma. When additional aliquots of these same specimens,  simultaneously stressed in the same ways, in which natural plasma had been  substituted for by the pregnant plasma rich in estrogens, a marked significant  reduction in the effux of both enzymes occurred in the female, but not in the  male, subjects. These results imply that some difference in erythrocyte response  exists between men and women, and that estrogens protect the female erythrocytes  against stress. It is speculated that the rapidly rising estrogens during  pregnancy may fortify women for their approaching labor, and more, broadly, may  be a factor in women's longevity compared with men.

Acta Endocrinol (Copenh). 1979 Feb;90(2):336-48. doi: 10.1530/acta.0.0900336.  The concentrations of urinary oestrone-3-glucuronide, LH and  pregnanediol-3alpha-glucuronide as indices of ovarian function.  Collins WP, Collins PO, Kilpatrick MJ, Manning PA, Pike JM, Tyler JP.  Methods based upon the principles of radioimmunoassay have been developed and  evaluated for the measurement of oestrone-3-glucuronide, LH and  pregnanediol-3alpha-glucuronide in samples of unextracted urine. The procedures  have been applied to daily urine (early morning fraction and combined 24 hour  collections) from 6 women throughout one complete menstrual cycle and to serial  samples from an additional 14 women who only collected early morning specimens.  The results showed that there were characteristic, well-defined changes in the  concentration of all 3 metabolites in both samples of urine and from all  subjects. In addition, there was a reasonable correlation between the  concentration of all 3 compounds in samples of early morning urine and the  corresponding rates of excretion per 24 hours. These findings suggest that the  procedures may be of value for monitoring ovarian function over long periods of  time, without the problems of stress and inconvenience to the patient.  Furthermore, the ratio of values for oestrone-3-glucuronide to  pregnanediol-3alpha-glucuronide may be used to indicate the start and finish of  the fertile period.  PIP: This study aims to develop alternative methods of monitoring ovarian  function over long periods of time. Methods based on the principles of  radioimmunoassay were developed and evaluated for measurement of  estrone-3-glucuronide, LH and pregnanediol-3alpha-glucuronide in samples of  unextracted urine. The methods were applied to daily urine samples (early  morning fraction and combined 24-hour collection) from 6 women throughout one  complete menstrual cycle and to serial samples from an additional 14 women who  only collected early morning specimens. The results show that measurement of  estrone glucuronide and pregnanediol glucuronide in samples of early morning  urine may be used to monitor follicular development and luteal function in women  who are well-motivated to collect urine according to a defined schedule. LH  values in the same sample may also be used to predict or detect ovulation. Mean  values of the glucuronides are higher in the early morning urine samples.  Corresponding values for LH are similar in both urine fractions. The project  ultimately aims to develop simple kits which women themselves can use to detect  their fertile period.

Jpn J Physiol. 1977;27(1):13-26. doi: 10.2170/jjphysiol.27.13.  Physiological and clinical studies on norms and variations in counts of  circulating basophile leucocytes.  Baldwa VS, Goyal RK, Garg KC, Varandani N.  Variations in the counts of circulating basophile leucocytes in 225 subjects  were studied. The results obtained are as follows: 1) The counts (per mm3) show  a gradual rise with growth, from infancy to adolescence, and maintain a fair  constancy in adults. 2) No significant sex difference was found in the  peripheral basophile counts. 3) A definite diurnal variation in the counts  exists, which is lowest in the morning and highest in the evening. 4) the counts  are altered in different phases of the menstrual cycle. 5) Pregnant women show  lower counts than nonpregnant women. 6) Surgical trauma and a single  electroconvulsive shock lowers the counts significantly but variations are not  significant after meals and physical exercise. 7) Smokers have slightly higher  counts than non-smokers. 8) course of irradiation therapy lowers the counts  significantly in patients with inoperable noplastic diseases. 9) Counts show  insignificant variation with alteration of blood glucose level. The results  mentioned above are discussed.  DOI: 10.2170/jjphysiol.27.13 PMID: 559189 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Serum-prolatic in women with premenstrual syndrome.  Halbreich U, Ben-David M, Assael M, Bornstein R.  Serum-prolactin was measured by radioimmunoassay during the menstrual cycle in  28 women who had the premenstrual syndrome (P.M.S.) and in a control group who  did not have P.M.S. symptoms. Throughout the menstrual cycle mean  serum-prolactin was signficantly higher in women with P.M.S. than in the  controls. The average individual increase in serum-prolactin during the  premenstrual period compared with the first 3 weeks of the cycle was also  significantly higher in women with P.M.S. It is not clear whether the increase  in serum-prolactin was merely an indicator of stress or was actually involved in  producing some of the symptoms which constitute P.M.S.

Laparoscopic tubal sterilization: long-term postoperative follow-up.  Rubinstein LM, Lebherz TB, Kleinkopf V.  PIP: 93 women who underwent laparoscopic tubal coagulation during 1972-1973 were  followed up for periods of 18 months to 3 years. Ages ranged from 17 to 47 years  (mean 30.7) and 71% had 2-4 children. 8 requested sterilization prior to  conception and 5 had pregnancy previously terminated by abortion. Most common  postoperative complaints were tenderness at the incision site and shoulder or  neck pain. In the 64 cases in which sterilization alone was performed average  blood loss was less than 50 cc. In 8 cases it was associated with diagnositc  dilatation and curettage, in 20 with therapeutic abortion, and in 1 with  laparotomy. Complications included 1 case each of bleeding mesosalpinx  controlled by cautery, wound hematoma, hematoma epiploic appendix, and  peritoneal burn. A detailed menstrual history 18-36 months after operation found  73 of the 93 had regular periods with amount of bleeding and length of cycle  generally unchanged. Of the 20 with menstrual changes, 2 developed amenorrhea  within 1 year and 8 with preoperative menstrual irregularities were unchagned.  10 developed longer periods and/or shorter intervals. 5 related these changes to  discontination of oral contraceptives. Of the remaining 1 had an abnormal Pap  smear, 2 were 40-45 years of age (1 of whom refused vaginal hysterectomy for  stress incontinence), and 2 were 35-40 with no previous history of cesarean  sections or pelvic complaints. The majority (77%) of the women were satisfied  with the procedure, 16% uncertain, and 5 patients expressed regret. 4 of the 5  who regretted the operation reported gynecological complaints. 5 required  subsequent surgery. In 3 of the 5 the indication preexisted the sterilization  and a more thorough screening might have prevented 2 surgical procedures. In  this series the incidence of postoperative gynecological disease 18-36 months  after laparoscopic tubal ligation is significantly lower than that reported in  the literature for conventional tubal ligation.

1049248,"Methods of birth spacing, maternal lactation and post partum abstinence in relation to traditional African culture.","Van Balen H, Ntabomvura V","1. J Trop Pediatr Environ Child Health. 1976 Apr;22(2):50-2. doi:  10.1093/tropej/22.2.50.  Methods of birth spacing, maternal lactation and post partum abstinence in  relation to traditional African culture.  Van Balen H, Ntabomvura V.  PIP: The importance of birth spacing and the role playedby maternal lactation in  achieving proper birth spacing in many traditional cultures in Africa are  discussed. The concept of adequate birth intervals, i.e. 2 or more years, has  been well accepted in many countries of Africa. Only very intensive, so-called  ""natural"" lactation will cause the important reduction in fecundability  necessary to achieve this spacing naturally. When the mother has no confidence  in her ability to nurse and begins to to supplement the breast-feedings,  lactation will become difficult and the contraceptive effect will be reduced.  Studies from several cultures are cited as to the effect of natural lactation on  the duration of postpartum amenorrhea. African cultures teach the symbiotic  relationship between mother and child. This cultural concept has extended the  natural contraceptive effect of lactation by prescribing various acceptable  periods of abstinence. Rapid change in values in these societies has overthrown  certain customs. Less severe practice of postpartum abstinence, use of  supplementary bottle feeding, and complete avoidance of lactation in certain  areas has undermined the contraceptive effect of lactation. Health education in  these areas should stress the beneficial aspects, both to mother and child, of  lactation. Supplementary contraception should also be mentioned.

1245850,Periodic psychosis of puberty. A longitudinal case study.,Teja JS,"1. J Nerv Ment Dis. 1976 Jan;162(1):52-7. doi: 10.1097/00005053-197601000-00008.  Periodic psychosis of puberty. A longitudinal case study.  Teja JS.  A number of reports indicate that many women experience minor physical and  psychological symptoms just prior to or during menses. Rarer episodic psychotic  states associated with menses have received scanty attention. In the few  available case reports, many hypotheses about their etiology have been advanced,  usually unsupported by systemic studies. A 15-year-old girl with periodic  psychotic episodes associated with menses was studied over many months. The  interval between her periods was around 45 days. Psychotic episodes usually  started a few days before or in association with menstural bleeding. Typically  characterized by withdrawal, negativism, an apprehensive attitude, and  suspiciousness, they remitted fully in 10 to 12 days with or without treatment.  To facilitate necessary behavioral observations and complete various  investigations, the patient was kept for nearly 60 days without treatment as an  inpatient. Repeated vaginal smear cytology examinations during the menstrual  cycle indicated a predominant estrogen influence throughout the cycle with an  absence of the expected progesterone predominance in its later part. The patient  gained 5 pounds between two cycles. Therapy with progesterone was instituted  following the observation period. This patient's Rorschach revealed strong  conflicts in relation to her sexuality. Concomitant with change in vaginal  cytology reflecting a more balanced estrogen/progesterone influence, the patient  stopped having psychotic episodes with menses. During a trial period when  progesterone therapy was stopped, the psychotic episodes recurred but were  prevented with its subsequent reinstitution. A complex interplay of hormonal  factors that brings heightened sexual drive and possibly water retention in a  predisposed patient can contribute to the causation of psychotic episodes at  menstrual onset. Menstrual bleeding can associatively facilitate sexual  fantasies and heighten conflict. Under this combined stress, the ego's defensive  structure is likely to crumble with resultant psychotic episodes.  DOI: 10.1097/00005053-197601000-00008 PMID: 1245850 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"
