BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of abdominal wall endometrioma (AWE) is often confused  with other surgical conditions. Certain factors relating to knowledge of the  clinical history of the disease make correct diagnosis and treatment difficult. AIMS: To present the clinical findings and ultrasonographic (US) features of AWE  with special emphasis on size-related features. STUDY DESIGN: This study reviewed abdominal wall endometriomas during a 2-year  period in the Radiology Department of Sifa University Hospital, Izmir. METHODS: Eleven women (mean age 32.6 years) with 12 scar endometriomas (mean  diameter 29.2 mm) were consecutively evaluated by US and Colour Doppler  examination (CDUS) prior to surgery. Lesions were grouped into large (≥3 cm) and  small nodules. Vascularisation was classified as location (central, peripheral  and mixed) and severity (absent, moderately vascular and hypervascular). In each  patient, the nature of pain (absent, cyclic: associated with menstruation and  continuous), historical and clinical data were documented. Four patients  underwent Magnetic Resonance Imaging and their findings were presented. Fisher's  exact test, χ(2) test for categorical data and the unpaired T-test for  continuous variables were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: In all the women, US of the AWE showed the presence of a solid  hypoechoic mass (less echogenic than the surrounding hyperechoic fat) within the  abdominal wall. There was a significant correlation between AWE sizes with  repeated caesareans and the mean time between the last operation and admission  to hospital (p<0.05). Large endometriomas showed increased central vascularity  (p<0.05). Cyclic pain was more frequent in small lesions, whereas continuous  pain was more commonly found in patients with larger lesions (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: AWE is often misdiagnosed clinically because endometriosis may occur  years after the caesarean section, the pain is often non-cyclic in nature, and  there is not always a palpable tender mass. The sonographic and Doppler  findings, along with proper correlation with clinical data, may substantially  contribute to the correct diagnosis of endometrioma.

Hormone withdrawal-associated symptoms: overlooked and under-explored.  Bitzer J(1).  Author information: (1)Frauenklinik, Universitätsspital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.  Johannes.Bitzer@usb.ch  Women using combined oral contraceptives (COCs) report hormone  withdrawal-associated symptoms (HWaS), including bloating, headaches and pelvic  pain, which might be due to withdrawal of exogenous hormones and fluctuations in  endogenous estrogen during the hormone-free interval (HFI). The prevalence of  HWaS is not yet well studied, but these symptoms may lead to reduced user  satisfaction and quality of life, and sub-optimal adherence to, and  discontinuation of, COCs. HWaS are often confused with treatment-related adverse  events because the timing of symptom occurrence is seldom considered.  Publications on HWaS are lacking, with few guidelines and no clear consensus on  the best treatment option(s). Reported treatments include continuous or extended  hormonal COC regimens, which extend the time of the active hormone. Although  extended-cycle regimens can cause unpredictable bleeding patterns, user  satisfaction is high, with several studies reporting improvement in HWaS.  Shortening the HFI is also a well-tolerated and effective method of reducing  HWaS, and confers a more predictable bleeding pattern than extending the active  hormone period. This may improve acceptance and long-term use of COCs. Future  prospects include estradiol-based contraceptive combinations with a shortened  HFI and more stable estradiol levels throughout the menstrual cycle.

BACKGROUND: The onset of menstruation is a landmark event in the life of a young  woman. Yet the complications and challenges that can accompany such an event  have been understudied, specifically in resource-poor settings. As interventions  aim to improve female attendance in schools, it is important to explore how  menstruation is perceived and navigated by girls in the school setting. This  research conveys rural Kenyan schoolgirls' perceptions and practices related to  menstruation METHODS: Data were collected at six rural schools in the Nyanza Province of  Western Kenya. Using focus group discussions, in-depth interviews, and field  notes from observations, researchers collected information from 48 primary  schoolgirls and nine teachers. Systematic analysis began with a reading of  transcripts and debriefing notes, followed by manual coding of the narratives. RESULTS: Focus group discussions became opportunities for girls to share  thoughts on menstruation, instruct one another on management practices and  advise one another on coping mechanisms. Girls expressed fear, shame,  distraction and confusion as feelings associated with menstruation. These  feelings are largely linked to a sense of embarrassment, concerns about being  stigmatized by fellow students and, as teachers explained, a perception that the  onset of menstruation signals the advent of a girl's sexual status. Among the  many methods for managing their periods, girls most frequently said they folded,  bunched up or sewed cloth, including cloth from shirts or dresses, scraps of old  cloth, or strips of an old blanket. Cloth was reported to frequently leak and  cause chafing, which made school attendance difficult particularly as the day  progressed. Attitudes and practices of girls toward menstruation have been  arranged into personal, environmental and behavioural factors. CONCLUSION: Further research on menstrual management options that are practical,  sustainable and culturally acceptable must be conducted to inform future  programs and policies that aim to empower young girls as they transition into  womanhood. Stakeholders working within this and similar contexts must consider  systematic mechanisms to explain to young girls what menstruation is and how to  manage it. Providing sanitary supplies or guiding girls on how to create  supplies serve as critical components for future interventions.  DOI: 10.1186/1472-698X-11-7 PMCID: PMC3129305 PMID: 21679414"

Catamenial hemoptysis and pulmonary endometriosis: a case report.  Yu Z(1), Fleischman JK, Rahman HM, Mesia AF, Rosner F.  Author information: (1)Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai Services at Queens Hospital Center, 82-68  164th Street, Jamaica, NY 11432,USA.  Hemoptysis can be caused by a variety of pulmonary diseases, including parasitic  infections, tuberculosis, chronic bronchitis and malignancies. Rarely, pulmonary  endometriosis can present with hemoptysis and pose a diagnostic problem to  clinicians. Pulmonary endometriosis can easily be confused with other clinical  entities, including pulmonary embolism, pneumonia and pneumothorax.  Histopathologic confirmation is difficult, since the bleeding site is not easy  to locate. However, a presumptive diagnosis of pulmonary endometriosis can be  made with a typical clinical history. Even so, medical therapy may be  problematic, with recurrence of symptoms despite hormonal ablation. We report a  case of presumptive pulmonary endometriosis in a 32- year-old woman with a  history of an induced abortion, who presented with catamenial hemoptysis  (approximately one tablespoon per episode) occurring in the first 3 days of  menstruation over an 11-month period. She was treated with an oral contraceptive  for two months. No recurrence of hemoptysis was noted during 18 months of  follow-up. The approach to diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary endometriosis is  reviewed.  PMID: 12357268 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Raftos M(1), Jackson D, Mannix J.  Author information: (1)School of Nursing, Griffith University, Nathan, Queensland, Australia.  raftos@aust.net  Information and messages concerning health-related issues are not confined to  material provided by official figures or sources. Much information exists in the  community and comes from a variety of sources. One such source is the media.  This paper reports the findings of a study conducted over a 12-month period of  advertisements for menstrual products in a selection of four monthly Australian  magazines (n = 48) directed towards young women. The study examined the way in  which menstruation and the menstrual experience were depicted in terms of page  space, textual content and visual images. Findings revealed that advertisements  for menstrual products provided confusing, conflicting and paradoxical messages.  These included stressing the normality of menstruation while also emphasising  the importance of keeping it hidden and secret. Menstruation was depicted as  being a state of tainted (idealised) femininity because of the potential for the  menstrual silence to be shattered by people finding out. Protection failure was  depicted as being the ultimate in tainted femininity and a result of a woman's  incorrect choice of product. Choosing menstrual-care products was depicted as  simple but, paradoxically, complex and confusing. Women were depicted as  liberated and sophisticated but images and language related to infancy were  used. Freedom and liberation were conferred by the use of the advertised  product. Overall, in common with previous studies, menstruation was depicted as  a crisis of hygiene that is a risk to femininity. Advertisements for pantyliners  suggest that femininity itself poses a threat to (idealised) femininity. This  study demonstrates the crucial role of the media as a source of health  information for young women.  DOI: 10.1046/j.1440-1800.1998.530174.x PMID: 9923315 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Author information: (1)Health Research Unit, National Research and Development Centre for Welfare  and Health, Helsinki, Finland.  Menopause (cessation of menstruation) and the period surrounding it  (climacterium) are often defined retrospectively by asking a woman the date of  her last menstrual period (LMP). Based on a survey of 2000 women aged 45-64 in  1989 in Finland, this study examines (1) the relation between these definitions  and women's own definition of their climacteric status and of the cessation of  menstruation and (2) the effect of menopausal and postmenopausal hormone therapy  and hysterectomy on the definition of menopause and climacterium. Agreement of  the woman's own definition of her climacteric status and interval since LMP was  25% among current hormone users, 41% among hysterectomised women and 64% among  those who were neither currently using hormones nor had been hysterectomised.  Current hormone users defined the climacteric phase as longer than their LMP  suggested. Current hormone use and hysterectomy had little effect on reported  final cessation of menstrual periods. It is concluded that hysterectomy and  hormone therapy shape women's thinking about the end of reproductive life, blur  the concepts of menopause and postmenopause and confuse the measurement of age  at menopause.

Perimenstrual symptoms and working conditions among hospital workers in Quebec.  Tissot F(1), Messing K.  Author information: (1)Centre pour l'Etude des Interactions Biologiques Entre la Santé et  l'Environnement, Université du Quebec à Montréal, Quebec, Canada.  Perimenstrual symptoms are among the most common disorders of women. Seven  perimenstrual symptoms were related to working conditions among 539 hospital  workers in a retrospective cohort questionnaire study, as part of a larger  examination of health problems and working conditions of Quebec hospital  workers. Only 8% of women had experienced no symptoms of discomfort associated  with their last menstrual period. Lower abdominal pain, the most common symptom  (58% prevalence), was associated with lifting weights (usually patients) in a  logistic regression adjusted for parity and contraceptive use. Back pain, leg  pain, swelling, and headache were associated with indicators of time pressure  and fast work speed. Back pain during menstruation was experienced by 44% of  workers. Studies of the prevalence and etiology of back pain, a common  occupational health problem among hospital workers, may be confused if  perimenstrual back pain is not taken into account. Similar reservations hold for  the results on other perimenstrual symptoms that are also likely to occur  outside the perimenstrual period, such as leg pain, irritability, and headache.

7962455,RU486: a compound that gets itself talked about.,Baulieu EE,"1. Hum Reprod. 1994 Jun;9 Suppl 1:1-6. doi: 10.1093/humrep/9.suppl_1.1.  RU486: a compound that gets itself talked about.  Baulieu EE(1).  Author information: (1)Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale, Unité 33, Le  Kremlin-Bicêtre, France.  In part, RU486 is 'the pill' awaited for centuries by women in difficulty and  still threatened by the danger of botched abortions in many countries. This is  enough for it to be the object of innumerable articles in the professional and  lay press, and of so many private and public debates. The recently demonstrated  possibility of stopping the development of pregnancy with a convenient  combination of RU486 and a cheap, safe, orally active prostaglandin, and thus  the potential of defusing in part the abortion issue, has again headed the front  pages of the news. The 'political chemistry' of RU486 (Hogden, 1991), which is  still in full swing, delays its introduction and its use by women in need,  particularly in the developing world, and by patients suffering from a number of  diseases potentially treatable by the drug.  PIP: In several industrialized countries, women can take the antiprogesterone  RU-486 orally, followed 48 hours later by a prostaglandin to interrupt early  pregnancy. The prostaglandin should be administered orally because of  cardiovascular incidents linked to the injectable form. It would have been  better if a hormone scientist associated with the development of RU-486 had  presented RU-486 as a menstrual regulator than within the context of abortion.  He proposes the term contragestion (contra-gestation) for RU-486 because it is  neither contraception nor abortion. He did not use the term soon enough after  RU-486's discovery, resulting in confusion. So the public began referring to  RU-486 as the morning after pill. France has one law for contraception and  another for abortion (termination after a positive pregnancy test). The law  requires women to wait 1 week after making the decision to undergo abortion  before actually undergoing abortion. There is no law covering the period between  conventional contraception and classical abortion. This left researchers only 1  option when testing and registering RU-486: under the abortion law. This further  prevented the acceptance of the word contragestion. Progestins and IUDs also  interrupt early pregnancy and are therefore contragestives. A key difference  between these 2 methods and RU-486 is that RU-486 use requires women to make a  conscious decision to interrupt the pregnancy. RU-486 should be a backup to  contragestive and contraceptive methods. RU-486 is needed because there is a  medical problem with abortion.

Ovarian function, therapy-oriented definition of menopause and climacteric.  Utian WH(1).  Author information: (1)Department of Reproductive Biology, Case Western Reserve University School of  Medicine, University Hospitals, Cleveland, Ohio 44106.  The lack of uniformity in descriptive terminology applied to the cessation of  human female menstruation and events related thereto has retarded scientific  progress and resulted in confusion and, perhaps, therapeutic mismanagement.  Inevitably, many published clinical studies do not clearly define the population  being tested, and conclusions drawn are misleading or invalid. Although  menopause refers to the final menstrual period (often defined retrospectively by  6-12 months amenorrhea) and climacteric to the transition from reproductive to  nonreproductive stage of life, the event is not necessarily associated with any  obvious symptom except amenorrhea. When symptoms do occur, collectively referred  to as the climacteric syndrome, they are generated by an interaction between  endocrine, sociocultural, and psychological factors, and perhaps concurrent  aging phenomena as well. Based on the premise that some women with intact  ovaries demonstrate endocrine compensatory mechanisms after menopause (i.e.,  that there are two types of postmenopausal ovary--one active and one essentially  inert) and that women whose menses cease because of surgery (ovariectomy) or  chemotherapy, they should not be included with those undergoing a natural  menopause (i.e., represent an atypical group), an ovarian function,  therapy-oriented definition for climacteric is proposed.

Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, University of Tsukuba.  A case of 43-year-old woman with Hashimoto's encephalopathy who experienced  three relapses closely associated with the menstrual cycle is reported. In April  1992, she began to experience occasional tremors in her arms. Three months  later, she experienced a generalized seizure and was transferred to our  hospital. Hashimoto's thyroiditis was diagnosed on the basis of high thyroid  microsomal titer and mild hypothyroidism. Neurological findings in admission  included action tremor in both hands, myoclonus in all extremities, cerebellar  ataxia, confusion, and hyperreflexia. Cerebrospinal fluid showed elevated  protein level without pleocytosis. Electroencephalogram showed diffuse slowing  and magnetic resonance imaging of brain was normal. Hashimoto's encephalopathy  was diagnosed from these findings. These episodes of remission and exacerbation  were observed during the admission. Her symptoms started at ovulation, worsened  during the luteal phase, and improved when menstruation started. After the third  relapse, she was treated with oral thyroxine for hypothyroidism and with an  estrogen and progesterone combination to regulate the menstrual cycle. Her  thyroid function gradually became euthyroid and she did not experience any  subsequent relapses. The relation between the relapsing course and menstrual  cycle suggests that the periodic alteration of gonadotrophic and/or gonadal  hormones or the menstrual regulating center itself in the brain may be an  important factor of pathogenetic mechanism of the disorder.

Flynn AM(1), Docker M, Brown JB, Kennedy KI.  Author information: (1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Birmingham Maternity Hospital, Queen  Elizabeth Medical Centre, Edgbaston, United Kingdom.  In this study, ultrasonography was used to detect follicular activity in  lactating women, and these findings were related to the underlying hormonal  profiles and to the mucus symptom. A number of different patterns of follicular  development were seen before the women returned to normal fertile cycles during  the period that was previously considered to be characterized by ovarian  quiescence. Some of the transitory patterns of follicular activity were  reflected in rising hormone levels and patterns of fertile mucus that were  sometimes confusing for these lactating women who were using natural family  planning.  PIP: The varieties of follicular development patterns seen on sonograms in  lactating women before return to ovulatory cycles are described. 18 lactating  women recorded mucus symptoms, basal body temperatures, breast and other feeds,  and took timed urine samples for assay of estrogen, pregnanediol, and were  scanned weekly. When follicular development or clinical symptoms suggested  incipient ovulation, more frequent ultrasonography was done. There were several  patterns of follicular development: multiple follicles, unruptured follicles,  recurrent persistent follicles, and delayed ovulation. In many women early on,  3-20 small follicles developed in 1 of both ovaries, averaging 8 mm in diameter,  with no release of estrogen or progesterone. 3 kinds of unruptured follicles  were seen: luteinized unruptured follicles, atretic follicles and persistent  follicles. Both luteinized and persistent unruptured follicles were accompanied  by hormone release, and sometimes by long periods of wet cervical mucus. One  women who breastfed intensively for 57 weeks had recurrent persistent follicles  without any hormone or mucus symptoms. A scenario of apparently normal  follicular development with an estrogen peak, but with ovulation delayed 2-3  days was also seen. Thus the previously held view that the ovary is quiescent  during lactational amenorrhea is invalid. Use of the symptothermal method of  natural family planning would be problematical urine prolonged lactation, given  these findings.

Spirtos NM, Eisenkop SM, Spirtos TW, Poliakin RI, Hibbard LT.  In women of reproductive age the usefulness of laparoscopy in diagnosing acute  appendicitis was evaluated. Eighty-six women underwent diagnostic laparoscopy.  There was complete visualization of the appendix in 93% of the patients.  Twenty-two patients were spared laparotomy. In the nonpregnant patients,  salpingitis was the disease most often confused with appendicitis. Eighty-five  percent of the patients with salpingitis had the onset of symptoms within 14  days of the last menstrual period, whereas acute appendicitis was found in 86%  of the patients with the onset of symptoms greater than 14 days after the last  menstrual period. The onset of symptoms relative to the first day of the last  menstrual period differed in these two groups of patients (p less than 0.01).  Patients who were spared unnecessary laparotomy had significantly diminished  hospital stays (p less than 0.001). Laparoscopy was found to be a safe and  effective way to diagnose acute appendicitis in women of reproductive age, and  its liberal use is recommended.

4038908,Late infertile days in early postpartum cycles.,Hatherley LI,"1. Clin Reprod Fertil. 1985 Mar;3(1):73-80.  Late infertile days in early postpartum cycles.  Hatherley LI.  Luteal phase abnormalities in early menstrual cycles after pregnancy have been  shown to cause confusion in the practice of natural family planning (NFP) for  some patients and to restrict severely the number of late infertile days  available to others. The cause of the abnormalities is uncertain but appears to  be related to the nursing status of the patient.  PIP: Over a 6-year period, 1975-80, all patients who requested instruction in  the use of natural family planning (NFP) after pregnancy were offered the  opportunity of collating their family planning observations with the results of  urinary hormone assays. Participants were asked to record the basal body  temperature (BBT) each morning at the same time and at the same body site before  arising or imbibing fluid, hot or cold. At night, on retiring, patients were  asked to record the mucus signs experienced during the day. The observations  recorded were the basic patterns of dryness, of infertile or of fertile mucus,  and the transitions between patterns of mucus signs. It was recommended that  charts be commenced immediately on returning home after an abortion and within 3  or 4 weeks of term delivery. 24 hour urine collections were assayed for total  estrogen and pregnanediol excretion commencing on day 7 for postabortion  patients, at 4 weeks for nonlactating postpartum patients, and from 6 weeks for  nursing mothers. Participants also were asked to collect urine specimens  immediately before ovulation as predicted by the peak mucus sign and again 3-4  days after the temperature rise. The charted mucus signs and BBT observations  were examined analogically with the results of the urinary hormone assays and a  marginal line, separating the preovulatory from the higher postovulatory BBT,  was drawn at the completion of each cycle. Patients were free to remain in the  study for as long as they wished, that is, until they were confident that they  could practice NFP without further supervision or until planned or unplanned  pregnancies occurred. Postovulatory levels of total estrogen excretion greater  than the preovulatory peak values occurred in a number of participants. Luteal  phases longer than 16 days were found in 6 patients during the study period. A  short luteal phase was common in all groups, especially in the 1st  post-pregnancy cycle. The important finding was the wide scatter of preovulatory  estrogen excretion levels before the 1st postpartum ovualtion, especially in  lactating women, yet the mean levels of estrogen excretion were generally  greater in non-breastfeeding than in breastfeeding women. Abnormal BBT charts  were restricted to cycles with short luteal phases. The position of the marginal  line on the BBT charts was stable over the first 3 cycles in 106 of 197 (54%)  participants and inconstant in 91 (46%). No significant difference was found in  the incidence of constant or variable levels of the marginal line in the  successful and unsuccessful participants.  PMID: 4038908 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Report of a case with fear bouts followed by prolonged confusion.,"Zappoli R, Zaccara G, Rossi L, Arnetoli G, Amantini A","1. Eur Neurol. 1983;22(3):192-204. doi: 10.1159/000115559.  Combined partial temporal and secondary generalized status epilepticus. Report  of a case with fear bouts followed by prolonged confusion.  Zappoli R, Zaccara G, Rossi L, Arnetoli G, Amantini A.  A right-handed 32-year-old woman had recurrent combined partial temporal and  secondary generalized epileptic states almost constantly related to  menstruations. During such more or less prolonged episodes sometimes the patient  presented right adversive attacks with short postictal dysphasia. The catamenial  status epilepticus observed in this cas was manifested in two clear-cut  behavioral phases. The first phase was characterized by frequently recurrent  left temporal epileptiform discharges without tendency to diffusion,  progressively more prolonged and pseudorhythmic associated with a signalized  feeling of intense fear without apparent impairment of consciousness or speech  disturbances. The electroclinical features of the first phase suggest a depth  origin of the paroxysms, probably due to a primary epileptogenic focus in the  left amygdaloid-hippocampal complex. In the second phase the left temporal focal  semirhythmic discharges associated with fear bouts became more frequent and  prolonged and began to be followed by long-lasting generalized discharges  resulting in a trance-like state with severe impairment of consciousness. The  diffuse paroxysmal activity regularly preceded by the left temporal focal  discharges was interpreted as a form of secondary bilateral synchrony constantly  triggered from a focal pacemaker represented by the primary epileptogenic focus.  During the very short transient periods of sudden cessation of the epileptiform  activity the patient returned immediately to an apparent normal mental state.  Good correlation could be established between different seizure patterns and  predominant clinical signs. Intravenous diazepam rapidly decreased and then  completely stopped the catamenial status epilepticus. Some problems related to  the classification of these rare epileptic events are discussed.

There is fever, diarrhea, vomiting, and profound shock with  mental confusion, decreased renal function, and a scarlatiniform rash that later  desquamates. Rapid recognition and vigorous fluid therapy is essential. There is  a relationship of menses, Staphylococcus aureus, and the use of tampons in the  etiology of this new syndrome.

12338519,Errors in age reporting in Bengali populations.,"Edmonston B, Bairagi R","1. Rural Demogr. 1981;8(1):63-87.  Errors in age reporting in Bengali populations.  Edmonston B, Bairagi R.  PIP: Reports on the major errors found in age reporting on population censuses  and sample surveys among the Bengali speaking populations of what is now West  Bengal, India and Bangladesh from 1881 to the present, and identifies cautions  necessary in using Bengali age data. The problem of adjustment is not discussed.  Age reporting is confused by the use of 2 calendars, the western (Julian) and a  Bengali calendar in which the year begins in the middle of April. The Arabic  calendar is also used among Moslems. Moreover, birthdays are not especially  emphasized in Bengali culture. 4 types of age misstatement are examined:  preference for particular ages, for age groups, for age digits (as years ending  in 0 or 5), and the interaction of random error. The influence of the progress  of literacy on age reporting is also examined. Special problems with reporting  children's ages are noted. Underreporting of children 0-4 was found, both from  underenumeration and from a tendency to inflate ages. A slight tendency for age  preferences (especially ages 4 and 5) was found, and random error increased with  age up to 7 years. Digital preference becomes more manifest with adolescence and  early adulthood, 0 and 5 the most frequent digital endings. The effect becomes  more pronounced among people over 50. Problems with data grouped by 5 year  periods are thus intensified. Errors surrounding the age of majority seem  especially critical for females. A tendency is to deflate the ages of girls  until after menstruation and marriage, when their ages are adjusted to those  more suitable for married women. Young unmarried females are heaped at 10-12;  young marrieds at 15. Digital preference persists despite literacy improvement.  Single year age data may be improved by analytical approaches such as standard  smoothing techniques or developing alternative age groupings to minimize the  distortion, or by more careful and sensitive data collection techniques. Data on  5 year age groups are seen to have become marginally acceptable in recent  decades, showing some effect from improved literacy.  PMID: 12338519 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"
455978,Presence of elevated circulating levels of LH during the pre-menstrual period in some copper IUD users and the possibility of their confusion with hCG.,"Dattatreyamurty B, Joshi J, Mehta S, Virkar KD, Sheth AR","1. Contraception. 1979 Mar;19(3):213-21. doi: 10.1016/0010-7824(79)90015-5.  Presence of elevated circulating levels of LH during the pre-menstrual period in  some copper IUD users and the possibility of their confusion with hCG.  Dattatreyamurty B, Joshi J, Mehta S, Virkar KD, Sheth AR.  A heterologous radioimmunoassay (RIA) capable of discriminating between LH and  hCG was used to measure LH levels in sera obtained during the pre- and  post-menstrual periods from 80 women bearing copper intrauterine contraceptive  devices (IUD). hCG levels in these samples were also estimated by use of a  homologous beta-hCG radioimmunoassay and a radioligand-receptor assay. Only two  IUD users during the pre-menstrual period had detectable, but low hCG levels.  However, LH levels, as estimated by specific RIA, in the serum of these two  women were elevated to a level that would cause detection at low levels in the  hCG assays. The data thus provide direct evidence to indicate that the positive  hCG levels observed by others during the pre-menstrual period in some copper IUD  users could be due to the interference in hCG assays by elevated LH.
