Women suffer from various conditions related to menstrual cycle due to changing  lifestyle, bad food habits, physical and mental stress. Pre Menstrual Syndrome  (PMS) is a combination of physical and emotional symptoms that many women get  one or two weeks before the start of their menstrual period. In the present  study, 14 years old female patient having symptoms-lower abdominal pain,  backache, breast tenderness, constipation, pimples, tiredness and unexplained  anger typically in luteal phase from last 4 months, was diagnosed with mild to  moderate symptoms of PMS. After proper analysis, she was suggested to consume  light to digest dietary articles advised in classical texts for minimizing  specific symptoms during menstruation.Thus Green gram Soup and Barley porridge  was prescribed to her as lunch and dinner respectively for first three days of  menstruation cycle for continuous 6 cycles. It is observed that consumption of  these dietary products during the menstruation time period assisted to minimize  the symptoms of PMS. This illustrates that there is a wide scope to explore the  ayurvedic dietary regimen recommended during menstruation which can be used more  rationally to suit menstrual disorders.

Treasure Island (FL): StatPearls Publishing; 2025  Jan–. 2023 Feb 19.  Author information: (1)MetroHealth Medical Center (2)Campbell University School of Medicine (3)Case Western Reserve Un/MetroHealth MC  Premenstrual symptoms include a constellation of mood, behavioral, and physical  indications that occur in a cyclic pattern prior to menstruation and then wane  off after the menstrual period in women of reproductive age. Most females have  only mild discomfort, and symptoms do not interfere with their personal, social,  or professional lives; however, 5% to 8% of women have moderate-to-severe  symptoms that can cause significant distress and functional impairment.   Although premenstrual symptoms have been recognized for a long time, the  diagnostic criteria have been specified only recently. The nomenclature for  premenstrual disorders has changed significantly over the years, evolving from  ""menses moodiness"" in the 18th century to ""premenstrual tension"" in the early  part of the 19th century to finally, ""premenstrual syndrome"" in the 1950s. While  some discomfort prior to menses is quite common, premenstrual syndrome (PMS)  includes the subset of women who experience symptoms that are severe enough  to impact daily activities and functioning. Late luteal dysphoric disorder  (LLDD), now known as premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), accounts for the  most severe form of PMS with the greatest impairment of women’s functioning and  perceived quality of life, often prompting them to seek treatment. Anyone who  has ovaries can have PMDD, including transgender individuals. Currently, PMDD  is listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th  Edition (DSM-5) as a separate entity under Depressive disorders, with the  criteria for diagnosis as follows: Criterion A - At least 5 of the following 11  symptoms (including at least 1 of the first 4 listed) should be present: 1.  Markedly depressed mood, feelings of hopelessness, or self-deprecating thoughts.  2. Marked anxiety, tension, feelings of being “keyed up” or “on edge”. 3. Marked  affective lability. 4. Persistent and marked anger or irritability or increased  interpersonal conflicts. 5. Decreased interest in usual activities (eg, work,  school, friends, and hobbies). 6. Subjective sense of difficulty in  concentrating. 7. Lethargy, easy fatigability, or marked lack of energy. 8.  Marked change in appetite, overeating, or specific food cravings. 9. Hypersomnia  or insomnia. 10. A subjective sense of being overwhelmed or out of control. 11.  Other physical symptoms, such as breast tenderness or swelling, headaches, joint  or muscle pain, a sensation of bloating, or weight gain. Criterion B  - symptoms  severe enough to interfere significantly with social, occupational, sexual, or  scholastic functioning. Criterion C  - symptoms discretely related to the  menstrual cycle and must not merely represent an exacerbation of the symptoms of  another disorder, such as major depressive disorder, panic disorder, dysthymic  disorder, or a personality disorder (although the symptoms may be superimposed  on those of these disorders). Criterion D - criteria A, B, and C are confirmed  by prospective daily ratings during at least 2 consecutive symptomatic menstrual  cycles. The diagnosis may be made provisionally before this confirmation.  Women with moderate-to-severe PMS or PMDD experience more quality-of-life  detriments and work-productivity losses and incur greater healthcare costs than  women with no or only mild symptoms.

INTRODUCTION: premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a prevalent health problem  affecting women of reproductive age and some young women use oral contraceptive  pills (OCPs) to prevent unwanted pregnancy. However, the association between OCP  use and the experience of symptoms of PMS has not been studied in Cameroon. We  examined the association between the use of OCPs and PMS among female university  students in Cameroon. METHODS: we used data extracted from a larger study on sexual and reproductive  health that was conducted between July and August 2018 among female university  students at the University of Yaoundé 1, Cameroon. A pre-tested, validated and  paper-based self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. We  extracted data (demographic and health characteristics, contraceptive use and  experience of PMS) for the 424 sexually active students who participated in the  larger study. We used Poisson regression analysis to examine the association  between OCP use and PMS and conducted stratified analysis to determine effect  modification. The level of statistical significance was set at p≤0.05. RESULTS: the median age of the 424 sexually active female university students  was 23 years (IQR=21-25). About 77.8% of participants self-reported to have  experienced symptoms of PMS prior to their last menstrual period. The most  commonly reported symptoms of PMS were breast tenderness (55.7%), acne/pimples  (39.2%) and abdominal pain (31.1%). After adjusting for confounders in  multivariate analysis, we found a statistically significant relationship between  the use of OCPs and experience of symptoms of PMS. Current OCP users had a  slightly increased risk (PR=1.21; 95%CI, 1.09-1.32, p<0.001) of developing  symptoms of PMS compared to non-pill users. We found that age modified the  effect of this association. Among older students (≥25 years), the direction of  the effect was strongly positive and statistically significant (APR=1.32; 95%CI,  1.12-1.56, p=0.001). CONCLUSION: the proportion of female university students who reported to have  experienced symptoms of PMS prior to their last menstrual period was high. The  use of OCPs was positively associated with the risk of developing symptoms of  PMS and this relationship was modified by age. Further studies in Cameroon and  other sub-Saharan African countries are required to understand this  relationship.  Copyright: Derick Akompab Akoku et al.

Approximately 33% of normal-length (21⁻35 days) cycles have subclinical  ovulatory disturbances and lack sufficient progesterone, although their normal  length ensures enough estrogen. Subclinical ovulatory disturbances are related  to significant premenopausal spine bone loss (-0.86%/year). Molimina,  non-distressing premenstrual experiences, may detect ovulation within  normal-length cycles. This prospective study assessed the relationship between  molimina and ovulation. After 1-cycle of daily diary and first morning urine  collections, women answered the Molimina Question (MQ): ""Can you tell by the way  you feel that your period is coming?"" and were invited to share (a) predictive  premenstrual experience(s). A 3-fold increase in follicular-luteal pregnanediol  levels confirmed ovulation. In 610 spontaneously menstruating women (not on  hormonal contraception, mean age 31.5 ± 5.3, menarche age 12.7 ± 1.5, cycle  length [CL] 29 days, MQ positive in 89%), reported premenstrual experiences  which included negative moods (62%), cramps (48%), bloating (39%), and front  (26%) or axillary (25%) breast tenderness. Of 432 women with  pregnanediol-documented cycles, 398 (92%) were ovulatory (CL: 29 ± 5) and 34  (8%) had ovulatory disturbances (CL: 32 ± 14). Women with/without ovulatory  cycles were similar in parity, body mass index, smoking, dietary restraint and  the MQ; ovulatory-disturbed cycles were longer. Molimina did not confirm  ovulation. A non-invasive, inexpensive ovulation indicator is needed to prevent  osteoporosis.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy, bleeding pattern, cycle control and safety of  a combined oral contraceptive (YAZ) containing drospirenone 3 mg and  ethinylestradiol 20 µg in a 24+4-day regimen in China. METHODS: This is a multi-center, open, one-label study. Healthy females aged  18-45 years received YAZ for 13 cycles. Following-ups were scheduled during the  treatment phase on Day 12-19 of Cycle 1, 4, 7 and 10 and 10-17 days after  completing the study. The efficacy variables were the number of unintended  pregnancies, bleeding pattern and cycle control. The safety variables were  adverse events (AE), lab examinations, physical and gynecological examinations,  vital signs and body weights and questionnaires. RESULTS: Four pregnancies occurred among 675 women for 603.78 women-years,  resulting in a Pearl index (PI) of 0.7 and adjusted PI of 0.6. The cumulative  1-year pregnancy rate was 0.66%. The mean number of bleeding/spotting days was  (26.3 ± 12.4) days in reference period 1 and (15.4 ± 5.5) days in reference  period 4. 94.2% (582/618)- 96.8% (538/558) subjects experienced scheduled  bleeding. The mean duration of scheduled bleeding decreased from (5.9 ± 3.2) to  (5.0 ± 1.6) days. The percentage of women with intermenstrual bleeding decreased  from 14.5% (90/621) at Cycle 1 to 2.3% (13/558) at Cycle 12. The common AE  relating treatment include nausea (3.4%, 23/675), breast tenderness (1.2%,  8/675), dizzy (1.2%), vagina bleeding (1.2%). No serious AE relating treatment  occurred. 85.6% (542/633) subjects were satisfied or very satisfied with the  study treatment. CONCLUSION: YAZ is highly effective, acceptable and safe for Chinese women.  PMID: 25030732 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Iran J Pharm Res. 2011 Fall;10(4):941-51.  Comparison of piascledine (avocado and soybean oil) and hormone replacement  therapy in menopausal-induced hot flashing.  Panahi Y(1), Beiraghdar F, Kashani N, Baharie Javan N, Dadjo Y.  Author information: (1)Chemical Injuries Research Center, Baqiyatallah University of Medical  Sciences, Tehran, Iran.  Different symptoms in Climacteric period, includes hot flash. Hormone  replacement therapy (HRT) is common therapy for relief of menopausal symptoms  but has possible contraindications and side effects. Recently Piascledine  (combination of Avocado oil with Soybean oil) showed effects in reducing hot  flash severity. Present study designed to compare the effects of HRT with  Piascledine in treatment of hot flash. The cases of this study were sixty-six  women at the age range of 40 to 70 years and complaints of menopause-induced hot  flashing, whose last menstruation dated at least 6 months prior to the beginning  of the study. The patients in this open label clinical trial, randomized to  receive Piascledine capsule 1 mg or HRT (0.625 mg oral daily Conjugated Estrogen  tablets, plus 2.5 mg continuous oral daily Medroxyprogesterone Acetate tablets)  for 2 month. Hot flash property and severity was assessed via a daily check list  and Visual analog scale. Climacteric symptom was measured before and after  intervention using Greene Climacteric Scale (GCS) and Blatt-kupperman Menopausal  Index (BKMI). Thirty-three eligible patients were allocated in each group. From  the Piascledine group, one patient and from the HRT group, 16 patients weren›t  willing to attend the study; therefore, 32 and 17 woman received treatment in  Piascledine and HRT groups. 4 patients were withdrawn for vaginal bleeding and  one for breast tenderness from HTR group. Hot flash severity in both groups  decreased during the time similarly. With regard to GCS (p = 0.571) and BMKI (p  = 0.891), the outcome was similar among the two groups. Due to low HRT  compliance and its possible risks in long period of time and considering the  same activity of soybean supplement and HRT in relieving the hot flash as  menopausal symptoms in women, it seems that soybean supplements can be an  alternative therapy to hormone.

Author information: (1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer,  Israel. dseidman@tau.ac.il  BACKGROUND: Continuous use of combined oral contraceptives is currently  attracting growing interest as a means of improving menstrual related symptoms  and reducing the number of bleeding days. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate bleeding patterns, menstrual symptoms and quality of  life with an extended 84/7 oral contraceptive regimen versus 21/7 cycles. METHODS: In two consecutive run-in cycles, 30 microg ethinyl estradiol and 3 mg  drospirenone tablets taken on days 1-21 were followed by a tablet-free period  from days 22 to 28 of each cycle and then by two 84 day cycles of pill use with  a 7 day tablet-free interval. The primary outcome was the total number of  bleeding/spotting days. Secondary outcomes were severity of daily symptoms,  general well-being determined by the PGWBI questionnaire, and overall treatment  satisfaction. RESULTS: Of the 137 women invited to participate in the study 109 (aged 18-40  years) were enrolled. The number of bleeding days decreased by about one-third  from a calculated 31.8 days of bleeding under a cyclic 21/7 regimen to an  expected total of 21.8 days for the extended 84/7 regimen. The incidence of  menorrhagia, intermenstrual bleeding, dysmenorrhea, abdominal bloating, breast  tenderness, depressive moods and irritability - when compared at enrollment and  at the end of the second extended study period--was significantly lower (P <  0.005) among women on the continuous pill regimen. The median (range) global  PGWBI scores were not substantially different before and after the extended use  cycles: 78.2 (39.1-96.4) and 77.3 (30.9-96.4), respectively. Body weight and  skin condition also remained constant. At the completion of the study: 65.5% of  the women were either highly satisfied (41.4%) or satisfied (24.1%) with the  extended regimen. CONCLUSIONS: The extended 84/7 regimen was found to be satisfactory for the  majority of participants and was associated with a decrease in the number of  bleeding days and an improvement in menstrual symptoms compared to 21/7 cycles.

Update of     Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2000;(2):CD001016. doi:  10.1002/14651858.CD001016.  BACKGROUND: Excessively heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) or menorrhagia is an  important cause of ill health in women. Eighty per cent of women treated for HMB  have no anatomical pathology, which makes medical therapy, with the avoidance of  possibly unnecessary surgery, an attractive alternative. Of the wide variety of  medications used to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding, oral progestogens are the  most commonly prescribed. This review assesses the effectiveness of two  different regimens of oral progestogens in reducing ovulatory HMB. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this review was to investigate the  effectiveness of oral progestogen therapy taken either during the luteal phase  or for a longer course of 21 days in achieving a reduction in menstrual blood  loss in women of reproductive years with heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB). SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility  Group Trials Register (searched April 2007), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2007) and  EMBASE (1985 to April 2007). Attempts were also made to identify trials from  citation lists of review articles. In most cases, the first author of each  included trial was contacted. SELECTION CRITERIA: The inclusion criteria were randomised comparisons of oral  progestogen therapy versus placebo or other medical treatments in women of  reproductive years with regular heavy periods measured either objectively or  subjectively and with no pathological or iatrogenic causes for their heavy  menstrual blood loss. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were  identified that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The review authors extracted  the data independently. Odds ratios for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean  differences for continuous outcomes were estimated from the data. MAIN RESULTS: No RCTs comparing progestogen treatment with placebo were  identified. Comparisons between oral progestogens and other medical therapies  were assessed separately according to dosage regimen.Progestogen therapy during  the luteal phase was significantly less effective at reducing menstrual blood  loss when compared with tranexamic acid, danazol and the progesterone-releasing  intrauterine system (IUS). Duration of menstruation was significantly longer  with the progesterone IUS when compared with oral progestogen therapy but  significantly shorter with danazol treatment. Adverse events were significantly  more likely with danazol when compared with progestogen treatment. Progestogen  therapy from day 5 to day 26 of the menstrual cycle was significantly less  effective at reducing menstrual blood loss than the IUS. A significantly higher  proportion of norethisterone (NET) patients taking progestogens found their  treatment unacceptable compared to IUS patients. However, the adverse effects of  breast tenderness and intermenstrual bleeding were more likely in women with the  IUS. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Progestogens administered from day 15 or 19 to day 26 of  the cycle offer no advantage over other medical therapies such as danazol,  tranexamic acid, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and the IUS in  the treatment of menorrhagia in women with ovulatory cycles. Progestogen therapy  for 21 days of the cycle results in a significant reduction in menstrual blood  loss, although women found the treatment less acceptable than intrauterine  levonorgestrel. This regimen of progestogen may have a role in the short-term  treatment of menorrhagia.  DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD001016.pub2 PMID: 18253983 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

OBJECTIVE: To examine the frequencies of reported symptoms by oral contraceptive  pill (OCP) composition among French women. METHODS: A population-based cohort of 2,863 women studied between 2000 and 2004  was used to compare the frequency of reported symptoms (weight gain, nausea,  breast tenderness, lower frequency of menstrual periods, breakthrough bleeding,  painful and heavy periods, swollen legs) by type of OCPs (classified by estrogen  dosage, progestin component, and sequence of administration). RESULTS: Results show little variation in the frequency of symptoms by type of  OCPs, with the exception of progestin-only pills being associated with higher  frequencies of breakthrough bleeding and lower frequencies of menstrual periods.  We found no decrease in the reporting of symptoms with the reduction of estrogen  dosage, nor with the use of third-generation OCPs compared with  second-generation OCPs. Likewise, we found little variation by sequence of  administration of OCPs (monophasic versus triphasic). CONCLUSION: In the absence of sufficient evidence-based data to support the  existence of differences in the tolerance profile of low-dose combined OCPs,  future well-designed randomized trials are needed to guide providers in their  choice of OCPs. However, research should also assess the effectiveness of  counseling on the tolerance of OCPs, an intervention that may prove to be more  rewarding than basing the choice of OCPs on their theoretical properties.

Author information: (1)Inönü Universitesi Tip Fakültesi, Turgut Ozal Tip Merkez, Nöroloji Anabilim  Dali, 44330, Malatya, Turkey. hozisik@inonu.edu.tr  Premenstrual syndrome is a term which includes a broad group of emotional,  behavioral and physical symptoms that occur for several days before menses and  subside following the menstrual period. Many women experience premenstrual  syndrome symptoms, particularly physical ones such as breast tenderness and  swelling. Approximately 5-10% women suffer from severe premenstrual syndrome and  another 30-40% have moderate symptoms. Premenstrual syndrome continues to be an  unsolved problem. In this study, we evaluated 24 premenstrual syndrome patients  and 20 healthy women in the control group. The ages of the women were 22-34  years (mean +/- SD: 25+/-3) for the premenstrual syndrome group and 23-34  (25+/-3) for the control group. The sympathetic skin response was recorded from  the palms, soles and genital regions by using electrical stimuli to the median  nerve at the wrist. The sympathetic skin response was recorded twice, in the  follicular and late luteal phases of menstruation. The follicular and late  luteal phase sympathetic skin response of the two groups were compared. The  amplitudes and latency values of the late luteal and follicular phase  sympathetic skin response from the premenstrual syndrome group and control group  women were statistically similar. We also did not find any latency or amplitude  difference in the sympathetic skin response obtained from the three regions of  the premenstrual syndrome patients and the control group. We checked sympathetic  skin response in the symptomatic (late luteal phase) and asymptomatic  (follicular phase) periods of patients with premenstrual syndrome, a disorder  known to have many autonomic symptoms, to determine whether there was sudomotor  sympathetic involvement. The results of our PMS patients indicate at the very  least that there is no difference with the control subjects as regards  peripheral sudomotor functions.

Previous research has shown that post-partum abdominal pain is greater in  multiparous than primiparous women (Murray and Holdcroft, 1989). Although breast  feeding in the immediate post-partum period induces uterine contractions and  abdominal pain, it is unknown how parity influences the contractions. Here, a  structured questionnaire that included the McGill Pain Questionnaire (total pain  intensity index, TPI) and visual analog scales (VAS) was used to evaluate the  intensity, location, referred tenderness (hyperalgesia), descriptor, and  temporal characteristics of pain during breast feeding up to three days after  uncomplicated vaginal delivery. Three groups of women were studied: primiparous  (n=25); low parity (1-2 prior births; n=14); high parity (3-5 prior births;  n=11). Uterine contractions during breast feeding were recorded using  tocodynamometry in some women from each group (n=17, 6, 7, respectively). For  comparison, an identical questionnaire was used to evaluate pains the women  remembered experiencing during menstruation in the year immediately preceding  the current pregnancy. During breast feeding, nearly all women (96%) reported  deep pain primarily at three sites: lower abdomen, low back, and breast, with  associated referred hyperalgesia in 62% of them. The intensity of these pains  increased significantly with parity (P<0.001), along with an increase in the  number of pain sites (P=0.03), mainly in lower abdomen and back, but not breast.  Similarly, both the mean duration and number of uterine contractions increased  significantly with parity (P<0.001). Furthermore, the mean duration of  contractions correlated significantly with the pain scores (P=0.03 [VAS] and  P=0.006 [TPI]). In contrast with pain during breast feeding, the intensity of  pain during menstruation did not change with parity. These results demonstrate  that pain, referred pain, and uterine contractions during breast feeding in the  immediate post-partum period increase with parity, suggesting that childbirth  can induce central neural changes that increase predisposition for pain during  the post-partum period.

Hale GE(1), Hitchcock CL, Williams LA, Vigna YM, Prior JC.  Author information: (1)University of Sydney, NSW, Australia.  OBJECTIVE: The purpose was to explore cyclicity of breast tenderness and  vasomotor symptoms in menstruating mid-life women using the Daily Perimenopause  Diary. METHODS: Untreated mid-life women from a convenience sample completed the Daily  Perimenopause Diary for clinical (n = 14) or research (n = 10) assessments.  Breast tenderness, sleep disturbance and day and night vasomotor intensity were  rated on a 0-4 scale with vasomotor number as a count. Daily oral temperature  data were analyzed using the Quantitative Basal Temperature algorithm to assess  ovulation and estimate luteal phase length. Analysis of variance tested  cyclicity using the mean of three 3-day windows (during flow, at mid-cycle and  premenstrually). RESULTS: Ninety-eight complete flow-to-flow diaries (from 24 women, mean age 47  years, cycle length 27 +/- 6.4 (standard deviation) days) were available, with  quantitative temperature data for 60 cycles in 16 women. Of assessed cycles, 90%  were ovulatory; 25% had luteal phases < 10 days. Breast tenderness was maximal  in the premenstrual window overall (p < 0.0001) and in the ovulatory subset.  Night sweats were maximal premenstrually (p = 0.0035) except in anovulatory  cycles. Daytime flushes were not cyclic (p = 0.1333) except in ovulatory cycles  (p = 0.031). CONCLUSION: Daily Perimenopause Diaries from mid-life women show premenstrual  increases in breast tenderness and night sweats.  PMID: 12841883 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"
11139745,Sex hormones and headache.,Silberstein SD,"1. Rev Neurol (Paris). 2000;156 Suppl 4:4S30-41.  Sex hormones and headache.  Silberstein SD(1).  Author information: (1)Jefferson Headache Center, Thomas Jefferson University Hospital,  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Stephen.Silberstein@mail.tju.edu  The normal female life cycle is associated with a number of hormonal milestones:  menarche, pregnancy, contraceptive use, menopause, and the use of replacement  sex hormones. Menarche marks the onset of menses and cyclic changes in hormone  levels. Pregnancy is associated with rising noncyclic levels of sex hormones,  and menopause with declining noncyclic levels. Hormonal contraceptive use during  the reproductive years and hormone replacement in menopause are therapeutic  hormonal interventions that alter the levels and cycling of sex hormones. These  events and interventions may cause a change in the prevalence or intensity of  headache. The menstrual cycle is the result of a carefully orchestrated sequence  of interactions between the hypothalamus, pituitary, ovary, and endometrium,  with the sex hormones acting as modulators and effectors at each level. Estrogen  and progestins have potent effects on central serotonergic and opioid neurons,  modulating both neuronal activity and receptor density. The primary trigger of  Menstrually-related migraine (MM) appears to be the withdrawal of estrogen  rather than the maintenance of sustained high or low estrogen levels. However,  changes in the sustained estrogen levels with pregnancy (increased) and  menopause (decreased) appear to affect headaches. Headaches associated with OC  use or menopausal hormonal replacement therapy may be related, in part, to  periodic discontinuation of oral sex hormone preparations. The treatment of  migraine associated with changes in sex hormone levels is frequently difficult  and the patients are often refractory to therapy. Based on what is known of the  pathophysiology of migraine, we have attempted to provide a logical approach to  the treatment of headaches that are associated with menses, menopause, and OCs  using abortive and preventive medications and hormonal manipulations.  Considerable evidence suggests a link between estrogen and progesterone, the  female sex hormones, and migraine. (Silberstein and Merriam, 1997; Lipton and  Stewart, 1993; Epstein et al., 1975; Goldstein and Chen, 1982; Selby and Lance,  1960) Although no gender difference is apparent in prepubertal children, with  migraine occurring equally in 4p. 100 of boys and girls, (Goldstein and Chen,  1982, Waters and O'Connor, 1971) migraine occurs more frequently in adult women  (18p. 100) than in men (6p. 100). (Lipton and Stewart, 1993) Migraine develops  most frequently in the second decade, with the peak incidence occurring with  adolescence. (Selby and Lance, 1960; Epstein et al., 1975) Menstrually-related  migraine (MM) begins at menarche in 33p. 100 of affected women (Epstein et al. ,  1975). MM occurs mainly at the time of menses in many migrainous women, and  exclusively with menses (true menstrual migraine [TMM]) in some (Epstein et al.,  1975). Menstrual migraine can be associated with other somatic complaints  arising before and often persisting into menses, such as nausea, backache,  breast tenderness, and cramps and like them appears to be the result of falling  sex hormone levels (Silberstein and Merriam, 1997; American Psychiatric  Association, 1994). In addition, premenstrual migraine can be associated with  premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PDD), also called ""premenstrual syndrome""  (PMS), which is distinct from the physical symptoms of the perimenstrual period  and is probably not directly driven by declining progesterone levels (Mortola,  1998). Migraine occurring during (rather than prior to) menstruation is usually  not associated with PMS (Silberstein and Merriam, 1997). Migraine may worsen  during the first trimester of pregnancy and, although many women become  headache-free during the last two trimesters, 25p. 100 have no change in their  migraine (Silberstein, 1997). MM typically improves with pregnancy, perhaps due  to sustained high estrogen levels (Silberstein, 1997). Hormonal replacement with  estrogens can exacerbate migraine and oral contraceptives (OCs) can change its  character and frequency  PMID: 11139745 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

BACKGROUND: Excessively heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) or menorrhagia is an  important cause of ill health in women. Eighty per cent of women treated for HMB  have no anatomical pathology and so medical therapy, with the avoidance of  possibly unnecessary surgery, is an attractive alternative. Of the wide variety  of medications used to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding, oral progestogens are  the most commonly prescribed in many western countries, although there is little  objective evidence to support their use, especially in women with ovulatory  menstruation. This review assesses the effectiveness of 2 different regimens of  oral progestogens in reducing ovulatory HMB. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this review is to investigate the  effectiveness of oral progestogen therapy taken either during the luteal phase  or for a longer course of 21 days in achieving a reduction in menstrual blood  loss in women of reproductive years with heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB). SEARCH STRATEGY: Electronic searches for relevant randomised controlled trials  of the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Register of Trials,  MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychLIT, Current Contents, Biological Abstracts, Social  Sciences Index and CINAHL were performed. Attempts were also made to identify  trials from citation lists of review articles. In most cases, the first author  of each included trial was contacted. SELECTION CRITERIA: The inclusion criteria were randomised comparisons of oral  progestogen therapy versus placebo or other medical treatments in women of  reproductive years with regular heavy periods measured either objectively or  subjectively and with no pathological or iatrogenic causes for their heavy  menstrual blood loss. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were  identified that fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this review. The reviewers  extracted the data independently and odds ratios for dichotomous outcomes and  weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes were estimated from the data. MAIN RESULTS: No RCTs comparing progestogen treatment with placebo were  identified. Comparisons between oral progestogens and other medical therapies  were assessed separately according to dosage regimen, progestogens given during  the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and progestogens given for 21 days  between day 5 and 26. Progestogen therapy during the luteal phase was  significantly less effective at reducing menstrual blood loss when compared with  tranexamic acid, danazol and the progesterone releasing intrauterine system  (IUS) and there was also a strong non-significant trend in favour of  nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Duration of menstruation was  significantly longer with the progesterone IUS when compared with oral  progestogen therapy but significantly shorter under danazol treatment.  Compliance and acceptability of treatment where measured did not differ between  treatments. Adverse events were significantly more likely under danazol when  compared with progestogen treatment. Change in quality of life was not  significantly different with progestogen and tranexamic acid therapy but there  was a non-significant trend in favour of tranexamic acid for all three  categories. Progestogen therapy administered from day 5 to 26 of the menstrual  cycle was significantly less effective at reducing menstrual blood loss than the  progestogen releasing intrauterine system (LNG IUS) although the reduction from  baseline was significant for both groups. The odds of the menstrual period  becoming ""normal"" (ie <80mls/cycle) were also less likely in patients treated  with norethisterone (NET) (days 5 to 26) compared to patients treated with LNG  IUS. A significantly higher proportion of NET patients found their treatment  unacceptable compared to LNG IUS patients. However, the adverse events breast  tenderness and intermenstrual bleeding were more likely in the patients with the  IUS.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and acceptability of the levonorgestrel  intrauterine system and norethisterone for the treatment of idiopathic  menorrhagia. DESIGN: A randomised comparative parallel group study. SETTING: Gynaecology outpatient clinic in a teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-four women with heavy regular periods and a measured  menstrual blood loss exceeding 80 ml. METHODS: Twenty-two women had a levonorgestrel intrauterine system inserted  within the first seven days of menses, and 22 women received norethisterone (5  mg three times daily) from day 5 to day 26 of the cycle for three cycles. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measure was the change in objectively  assessed menstrual blood loss after three months of treatment. RESULTS: When menstrual blood loss at three months was expressed as a percentage  of the control, the levonorgestrel intrauterine system reduced menstrual blood  loss by 94% (median reduction 103 ml; range 70 to 733 ml), and oral  norethisterone by 87% (median reduction 95 ml; range 56 to 212 ml). After three  cycles of treatment 76% of the women in the levonorgestrel intrauterine system  group wished to continue with the treatment, compared with only 22% of the  norethisterone group. CONCLUSIONS: Both the levonorgestrel intrauterine system and oral norethisterone  in this regimen provided an effective treatment for menorrhagia in terms of  reducing menstrual blood loss to within normal limits. The levonorgestrel  intrauterine system was associated with higher rates of satisfaction and  continuation with treatment, and thus offers an effective alternative to  currently available medical and surgical treatments for menorrhagia.  PIP: The efficacy and acceptability of two new approaches to the treatment of  idiopathic menorrhagia--the levonorgestrel intrauterine system and  norethisterone--were compared in 45 women recruited from a gynecology outpatient  clinic at a UK teaching hospital. All study participants had heavy regular  periods and a measured menstrual blood loss exceeding 80 ml. 22 women were  randomly assigned to have a levonorgestrel intrauterine system inserted within  the first 7 days of menses and 22 women received 5 mg of norethisterone 3 times  daily from day 5 to day 26 of their cycle for 3 cycles. Compared to baseline,  the levonorgestrel intrauterine system reduced menstrual blood loss by 94%  (median reduction, 103 ml) and oral norethisterone reduced it by 87% (median  reduction, 95 ml). Recorded in both treatment groups were significant decreases  in breast tenderness, mood swings, intermenstrual bleeding, and interferences in  daily life caused by menstruation. After 3 treatment cycles, 64% of women in the  levonorgestrel group indicated they liked the treatment ""well"" or ""very well""  and 77% elected to continue the regimen. In the norethisterone group, these  rates were only 44% and 22%, respectively. Although both regimens reduced  menstrual blood loss to within normal limits, the levonorgestrel intrauterine  system was associated with higher satisfaction and thus offers an effective  alternative to currently available medical and surgical treatments for  menorrhagia.

Contraception. 1998 Jan;57(1):23-8. doi: 10.1016/s0010-7824(97)00203-5.  Effectiveness of Cyclofem in the treatment of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate  induced amenorrhea.  Piya-Anant M(1), Koetsawang S, Patrasupapong N, Dinchuen P, d'Arcangues C,  Piaggio G, Pinol A.  Author information: (1)Siriraj Family Health Research Centre, Department of Obstetrics and  Gynecology, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.  A total of 100 women who were using depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) for  contraception and who had experienced at least 6 months of drug induced  amenorrhea, were randomized to either switching their method of contraception to  Cyclofem, or continuing with DMPA. At the end of 6 months, 82% of the Cyclofem  users had experienced some vaginal bleeding, compared with 10% of DMPA users.  Time to resumption of vaginal bleeding was related to the duration of DMPA use  to the duration of DMPA induced amenorrhea, and to the body mass index of the  user. Over the 6 months of follow-up, 94% of Cyclofem users complained of some  side effects, compared with 22% of DMPA users. The most frequently cited  problems among Cyclofem users included breast tenderness, abdominal pain, and  dysmenorrhea; yet a third of these women opted to stay on Cyclofem at the end of  the study. It is concluded that switching to Cyclofem is a new option for DMPA  users who are concerned about amenorrhea. Although using Cyclofem in this  setting will not meet the needs of all such women, its effectiveness in inducing  vaginal bleeding justifies a trial in those who have no contraindication to  estrogen treatment.  PIP: Substantial numbers of women experience amenorrhea while using the  injectable contraceptive depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) and this  represents a major cause of method discontinuation. In the present study, 100  DMPA acceptors from Bangkok, Thailand, with a history of at least 6 months of  drug-induced amenorrhea were randomly assigned to switch their contraceptive  method to Cyclofem (a combination of 25 mg of DMPA and 5 mg of estradiol  cypionate) or continue with DMPA (150 mg). After 6 months, 82% of Cyclofem users  compared with only 10% of DMPA users had experienced some vaginal bleeding. The  median time to resumption of vaginal bleeding was 8 weeks in the Cyclofem group.  Resumption time was related to the duration of DMPA use, the duration of  DMPA-induced amenorrhea, and the user's body mass index. Although 94% of  Cyclofem users compared with only 22% of DMPA users experienced minor side  effects (breast tenderness, abdominal pain, dysmenorrhea) during the 6-month  study period, 34% of these women elected to remain on Cyclofem at the end of the  study. On the other hand, 90% of DMPA users opted to continue method use despite  amenorrhea. The proven efficacy of Cyclofem justifies a trial in DMPA users  concerned about their amenorrhea. This regimen can be expected to induce vaginal  bleeding in more than 80% of users after 1-3 months of treatment.  DOI: 10.1016/s0010-7824(97)00203-5 PMID: 9554247 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of treatment with a  levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (IUD) in women affected by  adenomyosis-associated menorrhagia. SETTING: Tertiary care center. DESIGN: Prospective, open, noncomparative study. PATIENT(S): Twenty-five women aged 38 to 45 years with recurrent menorrhagia  associated with adenomyosis diagnosed at transvaginal ultrasonography  participated in this study. INTERVENTION(S): An IUD releasing levonorgestel 20 mcg/day was inserted in each  patient within 7 days of the start of menstrual flow. All of the patients were  requested to compile a pictorial blood loss assessment chart each month. They  underwent clinical and transvaginal ultrasound examinations 3, 6, and 12 months  after IUD insertion. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Menstrual pattern; serum hemoglobin, ferritin, and iron  level changes. RESULT(S): One patient experienced IUD expulsion 2 months after device insertion  and another requested removal of the IUD 4 months after insertion because of  persistent irregular blood loss. Six months after IUD insertion, amenorrhea was  observed in 2 patients and oligomenorrhea in another, spotting occurred  occasionally in 7, and 13 had scanty but regular flow. One year of follow-up has  been completed by the remaining 23 women: 2 with amenorrhea, 3 with  oligomenorrhea, 2 with spotting, and 16 with regular flows. Significant  increases in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and serum ferritin have been observed, but  the lipid metabolism and clotting variables have remained unchanged. CONCLUSION(S): Our findings indicate that marked and safe relief from  adenomyosis-associated menorrhagia can be obtained with the use of a  levonorgestrel-releasing IUD.  PIP: The efficacy and tolerability of treatment of adenomyosis-related  menorrhagia with a levonorgestrel-releasing IUD were investigated in a  prospective study of 25 women recruited from a tertiary care center in Italy.  All women reported recurrent menorrhagia of at least 6 months' duration and  underwent abdominal and transvaginal ultrasonography, hysteroscopy, and  endometrial biopsy before study entry. An IUD releasing 20 mcg/day of  levonorgestrel was inserted within 7 days of the onset of menses and follow-up  examinations were conducted 3, 6, and 12 months after insertion. 1 woman  experienced IUD expulsion 2 months after insertion and another requested removal  at 4 months because of persistent irregular blood loss. 6 months after IUD  insertion, amenorrhea was observed in 2 women, oligomenorrhea in 1 woman, and  occasional spotting in 7 women; the remaining 13 women had scanty but regular  periods. At 12 months, 2 women reported amenorrhea, 3 had oligomenorrhea, 2 had  spotting, and 16 had regular periods. All menstrual anomalies were well  tolerated. IUD-related side effects included headache (24%), breast tenderness  (16%), seborrhea or acne (24%), and weight gain (28%). Significant increases in  hemoglobin, hematocrit, and serum ferritin were recorded; there were no changes  in lipid metabolism or clotting variables. These findings suggest that insertion  of a levonorgestrel-releasing IUD represents a viable alternative to  hysterectomy in the treatment of adenomyosis. It is speculated that the IUD  produces deciduation and subsequent marked hypotrophy of eutopic endometrium.  DOI: 10.1016/s0015-0282(97)00245-8 PMID: 9314908 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

[No authors listed]  PIP: This special feature focuses on the care of mothers and infants during the  postpartum period. Postpartum care should include prevention, early detection  and treatment of complications and disease, and provision of advice. Most  maternal mortality is due to postpartum hemorrhage within 4 hours of delivery,  especially among anemic women. The uterus should be well contracted, and blood  loss should be minimal. Sepsis, as indicated by fever, should be treated with  antibiotics, but preventive measures include cleanliness and hygiene at  delivery. Infections are more likely after cesarean section, prolonged labor,  and early rupture of membranes. Handwashing prevents infection. Women should be  encouraged to pass urine in the first 12 hours after delivery. Bathing  frequently relieves painful episiotomy. 85% of neonatal deaths are due to  preterm birth and low birth weight. Keeping the baby warm helps prevent low body  temperature and infections. Parents need social support in adjusting to  congenital defects. Infants with infections should be recognized on time,  managed correctly, and referred to a district hospital. Breast feeding should  start immediately or within the first hour of birth. Mothers need adequate rest  and a nutritious diet. Breast tenderness is common during the first 4 days after  delivery. Breast feeding on demand and proper hygiene helps to prevent  infections and breast tenderness. Postpartum depression requires support from  families and expert advice. Exclusive breast feeding inhibits ovulation until  menstruation returns. Family planning may begin during lactation with a  progestin-only pill, IUD, or diaphragm. HIV-positive mothers should discontinue  breast feeding and take extreme care to mix formula with clean water. Mothers  should be immunized with two doses of tetanus toxoid. Pregnant mothers need  iodized oil and vitamin A supplements. Reproductive tract infections should be  treated.  PMID: 12321360 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

A study of the association between squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma in  the lung, and history of menstruation in Shanghai women, China.  Liao ML(1), Wang JH, Wang HM, Ou AQ, Wang XJ, You WQ.  Author information: (1)Shanghai Chest Hospital, China.  The menstrual history of 162 cases of female lung adenocarcinoma and 19 cases of  squamous cell carcinoma was compared with 187 age-matched female controls, and  analyzed for statistical significant differences that may exist between the two  groups using the Epi-infor program, the Chi-square test, and the Bartlett test  for homogeneity of variance. Parameters related to menstrual history included:  age of menarche, menstrual cycle, number of days of menstrual period, amount of  menstrual flow, menstrual pain, breast bloating/tenderness, and total number of  menstrual cycles prior to menopause or diagnosis of lung cancer. The results  show that cases of squamous cell carcinoma have a higher total number of  menstrual cycles than controls, raising the possibility that estrogen may play a  role in the induction of squamous cell carcinoma. Cases with adenocarcinoma were  found to have shorter menstrual periods than controls, suggesting that activity  of the corpus luteum may be related to the occurrence of adenocarcinoma.  Progesterone (PR) and estrogen (ER) receptor levels were also measured in 21  adenocarcinoma surgical specimens. A positive ER and PR receptor expression was  correlated with later menarche and earlier menopause.  DOI: 10.1016/s0169-5002(96)90224-x PMID: 8785664 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Riddoch GG(1), Duncombe P, Kovacs G.  Author information: (1)Monash Medical School, Box Hill Hospital.  OBJECTIVE: To investigate young women who were currently using oral  contraceptives with respect to their satisfaction, side effects, understanding  of long term benefits and anxieties. METHOD: The survey was completed by 227 attendees at Family Planning Tasmania  who completed a survey questionnaire during their visit. RESULTS: Seventy-eight per cent of respondents were 'very happy' or 'happy' with  oral contraceptives. Overall the group reported shorter, lighter and less  painful periods when compared prior to pill use, with slight increase in breast  swelling and tenderness as well as fluid retention. Overall there was weight  gain more often than weight loss during pill use. There was very poor  understanding of the long term benefits of pill use. DISCUSSION: Although oral contraceptives are the most effective form of  contraceptive, many women discontinue their use because of side effects. If  women are warned about these possible effects, they may be more prepared to  tolerate them. However, there is very little objective data available on the  incidence of various effects on Australian women. This study shows that the  single most important side effect reported was weight gain, and that we  recommend that women be counselled about diet when commencing the pill. There  also needs to be education about the numerous beneficial long term effects of  oral contraceptive use.  PMID: 9479798 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Cycle control and side effects of a new combiphasic oral contraceptive regimen.  Dieben TO(1), op ten Berg MT, Coelingh Bennink HJ.  Author information: (1)N.V. Organon, Oss, The Netherlands.  In a multicentre study 882 women were treated during a total of 12,850 cycles  with a new combiphasic contraceptive: CTR 24. The study period was 18 cycles.  The combiphasic preparation CTR 24 contains 25 micrograms desogestrel (CAS  54024-22-5) plus 40 micrograms ethinylestradiol (CAS 57-63-6) daily for the  first 7 days followed by the combination of 125 micrograms desogestrel and 30  micrograms ethinyl-estradiol daily for the subsequent 15 days. The bleeding  patterns were analysed over pill cycles and a comparison was made between  starters and switchers. The cycle control of the combination was very good. The  side effect profile was favourable.  PIP: Physicians recruited 882 women into a multicenter trial of a new biphasic  oral contraceptive (OC) (25 mcg + 125 mcg desogestrel and 40 mcg + 30 mcg  ethinyl estradiol). Trial sites were in Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France,  Germany, Norway, Sweden, and the former Yugoslavia. After 3 cycles, women who  had switched from using another OC in the 2 months before the study (switchers)  were less likely to continue the new OC than were women who had not used any OC  in the last 2 months (starters) (6 cycles = 87.2% vs. 90.6%, 12 cycles = 74.7%  vs. 79.5%; and 18 cycles = 59.8% vs. 64.9%). Withdrawal bleeding did not occur  in 3.2% of all cycles. Absence of withdrawal bleeding became less common over  time (cycle 1 = 7.6%, cycle 3 = 5%, cycle 6 = 3.2%, and cycle 18 = 1.8%).  Duration of withdrawal bleeding was no more than 5 days in 80% of all women.  More and more women had no more than 5 days of withdrawal bleeding as time  passed (cycle 1 = 81.7%, cycle 6 = 85.6%, and cycle 18 = 90.6%). Irregular  bleeding was more common in the first cycles of the study than in subsequent  cycles (e.g., spotting during cycles 1-3 = 8.5-4.8% vs. 3.7-3.1% during cycles  6-18). By cycle 18, 96% of all women had no irregular bleeding. The drop-out  rate for irregular bleeding was 2.2% at the end of the study. In 5% of cycles,  at least 1 tablet was forgotten. In the first cycles, starters were somewhat  more likely to complain of nausea, headache, and breast tenderness than  switchers (e.g., nausea, cycle 1 = 5.8% vs. 3.4%). The gap between the 2 groups  disappeared after 3 cycles. Starters were more likely to have minor complaints  before OC use than after OC use (e.g., 6.5% fewer frequencies of headaches at 18  months). These findings show that the new OC has very good cycle control and a  agreeable side effect profile.  PMID: 7945527 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

[Oral contraception with Moneva: findings of a cohort study of 6000 women].  [Article in French]  Szapiro N.  PIP: Between the fall of 1991 and the fall of 1992, 1500 physicians from  throughout France followed 5989 women, 13-56 years old, using the combined oral  contraceptive (OC) Moneva (30 mcg ethinyl estradiol and 75 mcg of the new  generation progestogen, gestodene) for 3-6 months for a total of 29,000 cycles.  Moneva was prescribed in 60% of the cases because the women did not tolerate a  previous OC. Moneva effectively prevented pregnancy. It reduced the rate of  abnormal cycles (5.4% of cycles vs. 0.9% at 3 months and 0.6% at 6 months).  Intermenstrual bleeding also decreased in frequency from 13.8% to 6.1% at 6  months. Amenorrhea occurred less often with Moneva (2.8% vs. 1.1% at 3 and 6  months). Moneva also reduced the length of the menstrual period (20.7% of women  with long period vs. 3.3% at 6 months) and excessive menstruation (1.4% vs. 0.2%  at 6 months). Pain during menstruation, breast tenderness, and secondary effects  occurred less frequently as well (37.1% vs. 13.5% at 3 months and 9/7% at 6  months, 13% vs. 7.9% at 6 months, and 15.1% vs. 11.1% at 3 months and 9% at 6  months, respectively). Secondary effects included headaches, nausea, and heavy  legs. Moneva did not affect body weight or arterial blood pressure. 95% of women  who took Moneva for 6 months were satisfied with it. 83.8% said that they would  continue to use it. In conclusion, Moneva is an effective, safe, tolerable, and  acceptable OC for women of all ages.  PMID: 12318672 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Bromocriptine (Bromergon, Lek) in the management of premenstrual syndrome.  Meden-Vrtovec H(1), Vujić D.  Author information: (1)Department of Gynecology, University Hospital Center, Ljubljana, Slovenia.  The efficacy of bromocriptine (Bromergon, Lek) was studied in a group of 21  women with premenstrual syndrome (PMS). To qualify for inclusion, the patients  had to have a score of 20 or more on Casper's Analog Self-Rating Scale for  Premenstrual Tension Syndrome completed during the last premenstrual week. The  study was designed as a double-blind, randomized, cross-over trial introduced by  a wash-out cycle. Patients received Bromergon in a daily dose of 5 mg from cycle  day 10 to the onset of menstruation for two consecutive menstrual cycles,  followed by two placebo cycles or vice versa. The subjects were instructed to  complete the scale every three days from cycle day 3 to the onset of  menstruation. A statistically significant improvement due to the administration  of Bromergon was observed in symptoms associated with overreactiveness to normal  prolactin levels, i.e. abdominal tension, edema, weight gain and breast  tenderness. Scores on the linear analog scale and physician's assessments  differed regarding psychological symptoms. The investigators observed no  difference in the presence of psychic symptoms in the treatment-free period, on  Bromergon therapy and during the administration of placebo. On the other hand,  self-rating scores reflected an improvement in the presence of depression and  irritability during Bromergon treatment. The results obtained suggest that  Bromergon may be a useful agent for the treatment of somatic symptoms associated  with PMS, while it seems somewhat less effective in PMS cases where psychic  symptoms are the major complaint.

Weng LJ(1), Xu D, Zheng HZ, Zhang JY, Sang GW, Qian LJ.  Author information: (1)Beijing Red Cross Chaoyang Hospital.  From October 1987 to May 1989, a total number of 527 women completed a total of  6,291 treatment cycles in 6 centers in China for the study of a triphasic oral  contraceptive - Triquilar. The mean age of subjects was 30.21 +/- 2.84 years.  There were 7 pregnancies during the study period. Among them, five were patient  failures because of missed pill or incorrect intake; one had taken barbiturates  along with Triquilar. Only one woman became pregnant in the 11th treatment cycle  without any reason being found. In most cases, menstrual flow decreased and  dysmenorrhea improved as treatment continued. Of the total treatment cycles, the  incidence of missed withdrawal bleeding was 0.25%, spotting 0.97%, and  breakthrough bleeding 0.48%. Nausea and vomiting was the most common side effect  and accounted for 6.4% of the total treatment cycles. This was followed by  breast tenderness (3.7%), dizziness (2.4%) and headache (1.6%). Most of the side  effects occurred during the first few cycles and were alleviated later. By the  end of one year, the total dropout was 64 cases. The reasons for discontinuing  treatment were: pregnancy 1.33 (per hundred women), menstrual disturbances 0.76,  side effects 3.80, other medical reasons 2.09, and personal reasons 4.18. The  results confirm that Triquilar is an effective oral contraceptive with good  cycle control and low incidence of side effects. No serious reaction has been  reported. It has been well accepted by the Chinese women. However, due to the  low dosage of steroids, it is of utmost importance to avoid errors in its  use.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  DOI: 10.1016/0010-7824(91)90145-6 PMID: 2036797 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

[The clinico-pharmacological characteristics of anteovin].  [Article in Russian]  Nikanorova SA, Kononova ES, Korkhov VV, Potin VV, Svechnikova FA, Boĭkova VV.  The clinical and laboratory studies carried out on 160 women showed a high  contraceptive effect and good tolerance of anteovine. The contraceptive effect  of the biphasic drug is determined by its antiovulatory action concurrent with  inhibition of the basal periovulatory secretion of gonadotropins and secretion  of sex hormones.  PIP: The results of evaluation of the contraceptive activity of the biphasic  oral contraceptive anteovin are presented. 1 package of anteovin consists of 11  white tablets containing 0.05 mg of ethinyl estradiol and 0.05 mg of  levonorgestrel and 10 pink tablets of 0.05 mg of ethinyl estradiol and 0.125 mg  of levonorgestrel. Anteovin was tested according to the conventional 21-day  regimen from day 5 of the cycle for 21 days, followed by 1 7-day rest period.  Duration of anteovin administration ranged from 1 to 12 cycles. Anteovin was  given to 160 women (aged 17 to 40 years old) who had a history of 618  pregnancies (182 ended by term delivery and 436 ended by induced abortion).  During anteovin administration none of the women became pregnant. Side effects  of anteovin included mild nausea during first several days in 12 women, breast  tenderness in 4, and menstruation disorders in 8. The mechanism of contraceptive  effect of anteovin was associated with ovulation inhibition. The changes in the  basal temperature had a monophasic characteristic. Colpocytological examination  showed decrease in the karyopyknotic and eosinophilic indices to 4-30%. All  estrogen fractions (estrone, estradiol and estriol) in the urine showed  statistically significant decrease on day 14-16 of the cycle (to 15.8 mcg/day,  compared with 41.9 mcg/day in controls). The level of pregnanediol in the urine  showed a decrease on day 20-23 of the cycle (0.66 mg/day, compared with 2.98  mg/day in controls). After 6 months of anteovin administration, there was a  decrease in the basal and periovulation secretion of follicle-stimulating  hormone, luteinizing hormone, and estradiol.

2224376,Factors related to self-reporting of the pre-menstrual syndrome.,"Warner P, Bancroft J","1. Br J Psychiatry. 1990 Aug;157:249-60. doi: 10.1192/bjp.157.2.249.  Factors related to self-reporting of the pre-menstrual syndrome.  Warner P(1), Bancroft J.  Author information: (1)MRC Reproductive Biology Unit, Edinburgh.  Menstrual health questionnaires were completed by a self-selected sample of the  readership of a woman's magazine (n = 5457). Sixty-one per cent of subjects  described themselves as suffering from pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS) and this was  largely corroborated by ratings of symptoms pre-menstrually, menstrually and  post-menstrually for the most recent cycle. Mood symptoms were more strongly  implicated than physical ones. Self-report of PMS was found to be modestly  associated with aspects of parity and oral contraceptive use, but strongly and  positively related to the duration of 'natural' menstrual cycles (i.e.  uninterrupted by pregnancy or steroidal contraception) and to psychosocial  stress. There were interactions among psychosocial factors and between  psychosocial load and duration of natural cycles.  PIP: Studies of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) have identified so many systems and  associated factors that it is difficult to assess whether PMS is a discrete  entity or encompasses a variety of cyclical phenomenon with differing  etiologies. A heuristic, retrospective study of PMS was conducted among 5457  readers of a UK women's magazine who mailed in a menstrual health questionnaire  that focused on the most recent menstrual period. 61% of respondents indicated  that they were currently suffering from PMS, 32% were uncertain, and 7% did not  experience PMS. Mood symptoms, reported by 65%, included irritability (65%),  anger for no apparent reason (64%), and easily upset (60%). Of the physical  symptoms, the most prevalent were abdominal bloating (45%) and breast tenderness  (40%). There was a remission of mood and physical disturbances postmenstrually  in 79% and 94% of sufferers, respectively. Oral contraceptive (OC) users were  significantly less likely to report PMS than nonusers, especially nulliparous  users. In addition, there was a generally trend for PMS to increase in  prevalence with increasing age. More significant was the finding that, the  longer a woman has been experiencing menstrual cycles uninterrupted by pregnancy  or unmodified by OC use, the more likely she is to self-report PMS. After 6  years of natural cycles, there was a higher prevalence of PMS among women with a  high psychosocial stress level. In women with no psychosocial ""load,"" PMS is  most prevalent in nulliparous women and after 2 years of natural cycles. These  findings suggest that PMS may persist as a result of biological sensitivity to  premenstrual changes, possibly interacting with psychosocial factors. Further  research will focus on measures of the severity of PMS clinical symptoms and  patterns of symptom change.  DOI: 10.1192/bjp.157.2.249 PMID: 2224376 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Privrel T, Daubenfeld O.  PIP: To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Minulet, a new low-dose  combination oral contraceptive (OC) containing 75 mcg of gestodene and 30 mcg of  ethinyl estradiol, a multicenter trial involving 239 women was conducted in  Switzerland. Of the 239 subjects, 187 (78%) were monitored for 6 cycles of OC  use and 24 (10%) were followed for 3 cycles, yielding a total of 1265 cycles for  observation. No pregnancy occurred during the study period, despite the fact  that 1 or more pills had been forgotten in 17.1% of cases. Cycle length and the  intensity and duration of bleeding were favorably affected by Minulet use,  especially in women with a prior history of prolonged, heavy bleeding. Spotting  occurred in 8.2% of subjects by cycle 3, but this rate was reduced to 5.9% by  cycle 6. Breakthrough bleeding alone occurred in 2.1% of the cycles. The  amenorrhea rate was 1.6% after cycle 6. There were no serious side effects, and  symptoms such as headache, depression, breast tenderness, acne, nervousness, and  dizziness were actually reduced as a result of OC use. Most notable was the  decrease in dysmenorrhea, from 40% before beginning OC use to 13% after 3 months  and 8% after 6 months. No significant effects on systolic or diastolic blood  pressure were recorded among study participants, nor were there significant  weight changes. Of the 17 women who terminated the trial due to side effects,  metrorrhagia accounted for 17% of the terminations, depression for 14%, nausea  for 14%, and headache for 13%. The findings of this trial, in terms of  reliability, cycle control, and tolerability, suggest that Minulet has  considerable potential as a new contraceptive choice.

No pregnancies occurred. One hundred and  sixty-one women (82%) welcomed the reduction in the number of periods with the  associated freedom from menstrual and premenstrual symptoms, and many found the  tri-cycle regimen easier to follow. Weight gain of more than 2 kg, irregular  cycle control, especially in the first three months, breast tenderness, and  headaches were the main side effects.

There were no pregnancies. In most cases the withdrawal  bleeding resembled normal menstruation. The incidence of metrorrhagia was  relatively low and when it did occur it was usually confined to the early  treatment cycles and was of very limited duration. The objective and subjective  tolerance was excellent.  PIP: Pregnon is a new low-dosage ovulation-inhibiting agent containing 1 mg of  lynestrenol and .05 mg of ethinyl estradiol in each tablet. It is also marketed  under the name of Pregnon 28 or Ovostat 28 in which each package contains 22  active plus 6 placebo tablets. Data were collected from Belgian clinics and  evaluated by the Medical Unit of Organon in Belgium and the Netherlands. During  this study, 639 women of fertile age were monitored through 9159 cycles. The  maximum period of treatment was 36 cycles. Clinical and gynecological  examinations were made before treatment and then every 2 or 3 months. Treatment  was begun by taking the 1st tablet on the 1st day of menstruation. After taking  22 tablets there was a 6-day tablet-free interval during which withdrawal  bleeding usually occurred. The intensity of the withdrawal bleeding was normal  in 57.3%, slight in 41.7%, and heavy in 1%. Spotting was noted in 3.1% of the  cycles and breakthrough bleeding occurred in 2.9%. Usually they occurred in the  first 3 cycles. Amenorrhea was observed in 2.9% of the cycles. Body weights were  relatively unchanged. Blood pressures remained the same. Side effects were  headache, nausea, vomiting, breast tenderness, heavy legs, leucorrhea,  nervousness, depression, and decreased libido. Only 46 patients discontinued  treatment because of these drug effects yielding an acceptability level of about  93%. Since no pregnancies occurred during this study, the Pearl index was 0.
