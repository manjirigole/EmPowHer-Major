Phenylketonuria (PKU) results from a deficiency in phenylalanine hydroxylase,  catalyzing the conversion of phenylalanine (Phe) to tyrosine. Premenstrual  syndrome (PMS) consists of physical, behavioral, and emotional symptoms  occurring during the last week of luteal phase. The aim of the study was to  determine the incidence of PMS, and document menstrual cycle characteristics of  PKU patients to reveal the relationship with blood Phe levels. The study was  conducted on 74 patients with a mean age of 21.7 ± 5.4 years. The mean age at  menarche was 12.7 ± 1.3 years and 82.4 % had regular menstrual cycles. The  periods of most patients (47.2 %) lasted 4-5 days. Menstrual cycles of  21-28 days were reported by 73 %, less than 21 days by 8 %, and more than  28 days by 19 % of women. Menorrhagia and dysmenorrhea was observed in 6.7 % and  71.6 % respectively. Adherence to diet was lost in 7 patients during the  menstrual period. No significant relationship was found between Phe levels and  PMS symptoms (p > 0.05). According to PMSS subscales, 52.7 % of patients with  PKU had depressive feelings, 16.2 % anxiety, 55.4 % fatigue, 52.7 %  irritability, 28.3 % depressive thoughts, 39.1 % pain, 59.4 % changes in  appetite, 28.3 % changes in sleeping habits and 43.2 % had swelling. The  findings of the study revealed that PMS prevalence was 39.1 % among PKU women.  Awareness about this syndrome, will improve the quality of life in women with  PKU by evaluating and taking measures for PMS. SYNOPSIS: Evaluating menstrual cycle characteristics and premenstrual syndrome  in phenylketonuria patients provides valuable insights for enhancing their  overall health profile and personalizing treatment and management plans.  © 2024 The Authors.

Treasure Island (FL): StatPearls Publishing; 2025  Jan–. 2023 Feb 19.  Author information: (1)MetroHealth Medical Center (2)Campbell University School of Medicine (3)Case Western Reserve Un/MetroHealth MC  Premenstrual symptoms include a constellation of mood, behavioral, and physical  indications that occur in a cyclic pattern prior to menstruation and then wane  off after the menstrual period in women of reproductive age. Most females have  only mild discomfort, and symptoms do not interfere with their personal, social,  or professional lives; however, 5% to 8% of women have moderate-to-severe  symptoms that can cause significant distress and functional impairment.   Although premenstrual symptoms have been recognized for a long time, the  diagnostic criteria have been specified only recently. The nomenclature for  premenstrual disorders has changed significantly over the years, evolving from  ""menses moodiness"" in the 18th century to ""premenstrual tension"" in the early  part of the 19th century to finally, ""premenstrual syndrome"" in the 1950s. While  some discomfort prior to menses is quite common, premenstrual syndrome (PMS)  includes the subset of women who experience symptoms that are severe enough  to impact daily activities and functioning. Late luteal dysphoric disorder  (LLDD), now known as premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), accounts for the  most severe form of PMS with the greatest impairment of women’s functioning and  perceived quality of life, often prompting them to seek treatment. Anyone who  has ovaries can have PMDD, including transgender individuals. Currently, PMDD  is listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th  Edition (DSM-5) as a separate entity under Depressive disorders, with the  criteria for diagnosis as follows: Criterion A - At least 5 of the following 11  symptoms (including at least 1 of the first 4 listed) should be present: 1.  Markedly depressed mood, feelings of hopelessness, or self-deprecating thoughts.  2. Marked anxiety, tension, feelings of being “keyed up” or “on edge”. 3. Marked  affective lability. 4. Persistent and marked anger or irritability or increased  interpersonal conflicts. 5. Decreased interest in usual activities (eg, work,  school, friends, and hobbies). 6. Subjective sense of difficulty in  concentrating. 7. Lethargy, easy fatigability, or marked lack of energy. 8.  Marked change in appetite, overeating, or specific food cravings. 9. Hypersomnia  or insomnia. 10. A subjective sense of being overwhelmed or out of control. 11.  Other physical symptoms, such as breast tenderness or swelling, headaches, joint  or muscle pain, a sensation of bloating, or weight gain. Criterion B  - symptoms  severe enough to interfere significantly with social, occupational, sexual, or  scholastic functioning. Criterion C  - symptoms discretely related to the  menstrual cycle and must not merely represent an exacerbation of the symptoms of  another disorder, such as major depressive disorder, panic disorder, dysthymic  disorder, or a personality disorder (although the symptoms may be superimposed  on those of these disorders). Criterion D - criteria A, B, and C are confirmed  by prospective daily ratings during at least 2 consecutive symptomatic menstrual  cycles. The diagnosis may be made provisionally before this confirmation.  Women with moderate-to-severe PMS or PMDD experience more quality-of-life  detriments and work-productivity losses and incur greater healthcare costs than  women with no or only mild symptoms.

25392096,"In contrast to leptin, serum concentrations of ghrelin are not related to premenstrual syndrome.","Unlu BS, Koken G, Celik F, Mert N, Yildiz Y, Koca B, Yilmazer M","1. Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2014 Oct;18(20):3010-5.  In contrast to leptin, serum concentrations of ghrelin are not related to  premenstrual syndrome.  Unlu BS(1), Koken G, Celik F, Mert N, Yildiz Y, Koca B, Yilmazer M.  Author information: (1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Faculty of Medicine, University of  Afyon Kocatepe, Afyonkarahisar, Turkey. drserdarunlu@yahoo.com.  OBJECTIVE: Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a disorder related to mood and  appetite changes during the premenstrual phase. Unfortunately, the understanding  of the pathophysiology of PMS is quite poor. Though, ghrelin and leptin play  important roles in the control of food intake. The aim of this study was to  evaluate leptin and ghrelin serum concentrations in PMS patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-five PMS patients diagnosed according to ICD-10  diagnostic criteria and 45 healthy women as a control group, were included in  the study. These groups were matched for age, body mass index and duration of  menstrual cycle. Symptoms of the patients were evaluated using ""Menstrual  Distress Questionnaires"". Serum leptin and ghrelin serum concentrations were  measured using ELISA in the postmenstrual phase (5-9 days) and 2-3 days before  menstruation. Mann-Whitney U test, independent sample t-test and Wilcoxon test  were used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: In the PMS group, there was no difference in the serum concentrations  of ghrelin; however, leptin serum concentrations were 31.05 (± 14.16) and 16.42  (± 15.81) ng/ml during the premenstrual and postmenstrual periods, respectively  (p < 0.05). Ghrelin serum concentrations in the premenstrual period were 6.9 (±  9.3) ng/ml in the PMS group and 8.8 (± 9.3) ng/ml in the control group, but this  difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.79). CONCLUSIONS: Ghrelin serum concentrations were not associated with PMS, while  leptin serum concentrations were found to be higher in the premenstrual period  in PMS patients. Though, these two hormones work antagonistically to control the  food intake and body weight, we suggest that this function is not relevant to  PMS.  PMID: 25392096 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Buffenstein R(1), Karklin A, Driver HS.  Author information: (1)Department of Physiology, Medical School of the University of the  Witwatersrand, 7 York Road, Parktown Johannesburg, South Africa.  rochelle@harold.sci.ccny.cuny.edu  Changes in mood, performance, cortisol, and physiological variables with a  month-long energy restricting diet (3.347 MJ/day) were studied in nine  overweight (mean mass 71.2 +/- 8 kg; body mass index 26.1 +/- 2.8 kg/m(2)),  healthy premenopausal (age 20-36 years) women. Measurements were taken in the 2  weeks before the diet (baseline) and again in the final 2 weeks of the diet to  attenuate menstrual cycle differences. A reduction in energy intake and  concomitant weight loss (5.80 +/- 1.65 kg) were accompanied by a significant  decline in systolic blood pressure (5.4%), heart rate (7.6%), and cortisol  concentration (13.6%). Fatigue and vigour on the Profile of Mood States (POMS)  questionnaire were adversely affected; however, subjective assessments of mood,  concentration, temperature sensitivity, appetite, and sleep quality using visual  analogue scales, were not significantly altered during the month-long period of  energy restriction. Motor performance, as assessed by hand-eye coordination,  improved with both a reduction in mean reaction time and improved accuracy in  response to visual stimuli. The very low-energy diet appeared to be neither  physiologically nor psychologically stressful. Beneficial effects were evident  with a reduction in BMI, reduced risk of cardiovascular stress, improved motor  performance, and a decline in physiological stress with dieting success.

7662690,Contraceptive implant use among inner city teens.,"Glantz S, Schaff E, Campbell-Heider N, Glantz JC, Bartlett M","1. J Adolesc Health. 1995 May;16(5):389-95. doi: 10.1016/S1054-139X(94)00072-M.  Contraceptive implant use among inner city teens.  Glantz S(1), Schaff E, Campbell-Heider N, Glantz JC, Bartlett M.  Author information: (1)Anthony Jordan Health Center, Rochester, NY 14605, USA.  PURPOSES: This study develops a clinical profile of urban teens who selected  Norplant for contraception; determines which variables identify the subjects  most likely to be compliant with the method; and determines the most common  reasons for early termination of use. METHODS: Demographic and health history data and reasons for termination of use  were collected prospectively for 122 inner city teens who received Norplant.  Life table analysis and the Mantel-Haenszel procedure were used to investigate  differences between Norplant retainers and terminators. RESULTS: The sample consisted of black and Hispanic teens between the ages of  13-19 years, the majority of whom had one or more children and were in school.  One and two year retention rates were 71% and 62%. The highest removal rates  occurred during the 3-6 month interval after insertion. A significant finding  was that teens who have experienced induced abortion were more likely to retain  Norplant. Common reasons for termination of use included general and social  concerns, including pregnancy desire. CONCLUSIONS: Norplant retention rates for this teen sample were greater than the  compliance rates reported for other conventional methods. Similar to  noncompliance with oral contraceptives, discontinuance of the method was most  likely to occur in the first 6 months of use. A history of induced abortion  identifies those teens most likely to retain Norplant, suggesting that these  teens might evaluate contraceptive risks and benefits differently than those  with no abortion history. Pregnancy desire was a common reason for terminating  Norplant use.  PIP: This prospective study of 122 Black and Hispanic inner-city adolescent  Norplant users recruited from a teen clinic in Rochester, New York, was the  first to include a two-year follow-up period. The study period extended from  June 1, 1991, to June 30, 1993. The mean age of Norplant acceptors was 17.4  years; 76% had a parity of at least one. Recorded was a one-year retention rate  of 71% and a two-year rate of 62%. The greatest number of removals occurred in  the first three months after insertion. There was no association between  Norplant retention and age, weight, race, parity, or school status. The only  significant predictor of Norplant continuation was a history of at least one  induced abortion. The reasons most frequently cited by the 30 adolescents who  discontinued Norplant were headache, fatigue, hair loss, nausea, weight changes,  breast symptoms, and appetite changes. Menstruation irregularities were reported  only by terminators in the 3-6 month use interval. Considering the high  continuation rates recorded in this survey and the method's proven  effectiveness, Norplant has the potential to widen substantially the birth  interval between adolescent pregnancies.

7662688,Depo-Provera in adolescents: effects of early second injection or prior oral contraception.,"Harel Z, Biro FM, Kollar LM","1. J Adolesc Health. 1995 May;16(5):379-84. doi: 10.1016/S1054-139X(95)00094-9.  Depo-Provera in adolescents: effects of early second injection or prior oral  contraception.  Harel Z(1), Biro FM, Kollar LM.  Author information: (1)Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital, Cincinnati, Ohio 45229, USA.  PURPOSE: To examine the effects of an early second injection or prior use of  oral contraceptive pills (OCP) on side effects of Depo-Provera during the early  months of use in adolescents. METHODS: Thirty-six girls, gynecologic age 4.2 +/- 0.3 years, and body mass  index (BMI) 23.2 +/- 0.8, received the currently recommended injection of 150 mg  every three months. Twenty-seven girls (gynecologic age 3.9 +/- 0.5 years, BMI  24.0 +/- 0.8) received the second injection six weeks after the first injection.  Fifteen girls (gynecologic age 5.0 +/- 0.5, BMI 25.4 +/- 1.3) switched directly  from an OCP to Depo-Provera. The patients were periodically assessed by their  care providers. RESULTS: Early administration of the second injection of Depo-Provera did not  alter the bleeding episodes, onset of bleeding, or total days of bleeding (14.3  +/- 3.7 vs. 17.1 +/- 4.0, p = 0.62) during the three months interval following  injection, compared with the standard second injection interval. Moreover, an  excessive BMI gain (BMI increase 0.99 +/- 0.22 vs. 0.40 +/- 0.14, p = 0.03) was  observed in these girls. Girls who switched directly from OCP showed no  difference in the rate of BMI gain when compared to those not previously on OCP  (BMI increase 0.38 +/- 0.3). Bleeding duration of these girls, however, was  markedly reduced; the total number of days of bleeding was 5.7 +/- 1.9 (p =  0.0003) during the first three month interval, and 5.7 +/- 2.3 (p = 0.019)  during the three month period following the second injection. This reduction did  not persist beyond the first six months. CONCLUSIONS: Early second Depo-Provera injection does not alter the experience  of menstrual abnormalities, and predisposes to greater weight gain; OCP use  prior to Depo-Provera results in a decrease in the duration of bleeding with no  change in the weight gain rate.  PIP: The capability of an early second injection or prior use of oral  contraceptives (OCs) to improve satisfaction and long-term continuation of  Depo-Provera in adolescents was investigated in a clinical trial involving 78  females 12-20 years of age (average, 15.9 years) recruited from a hospital-based  adolescent health clinic. 36 subjects received injection of 150 mg of  Depo-Provera every three months (Group 1), 27 received the second injection  after only six weeks (Group 2), and 15 switched directly from OCs to the  standard Depo-Provera regimen (Group 3). There was no difference between Groups  1 and 2 in terms of duration or frequency of menstrual bleeding; however, prior  OC users experienced a significant reduction in the duration and intensity of  bleeding in the first six months of Depo-Provera use (when estrogen was still  present in the women's systems). Overall, 64% of study subjects reported less  dysmenorrhea while on Depo-Provera. A slightly greater change in body mass index  was observed among girls in Group 2 than in Groups 1 and 3; moreover, 70% of  those in the early injection group reported increased appetite and weight gain  compared to 39% of those on the standard schedule. The most commonly reported  side effects included initial pain and soreness at the injection site (27%),  decreased libido (56%), mood changes (31%), depression (26%), frequent headache  (25%), fatigue (24%), and increase in acne (15%); there were no significant  differences by group. 17 adolescents (22%) discontinued Depo-Provera, generally  after two injections and due to bleeding irregularities or weight gain. 87% of  adolescents who were prior OC users, 52% of those on the regular schedule, and  39% of those who received an early injection stated they were very satisfied  with Depo-Provera. These findings indicate that early second Depo-Provera  injection offers no advantages; use of OCs immediately prior to Depo-Provera  should be further investigated, however, given its potential to minimize  bleeding problems.

2975377,Injectable contraception.,Wilson E,"1. Practitioner. 1988 Jan;232(1441):32-6.  Injectable contraception.  Wilson E.  PIP: When given in a dose of 150 mg every 12 weeks, depot medroxyprogesterone  acetate (DMPA) is highly effective contraceptive agent. DMPA has a pregnancy  rate of 0.5/1000 woman-years of use, no life-threatening side effects, and no  permanent effect on fertility. Other advantages include DMPA's lack of  interference with lactation, reductions in the incidence of pelvic inflammatory  disease and vaginal candidiasis, elimination of premenstrual syndrome, relief of  dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia, and a reduction in homozygous sickle cell disease  crises. Although DMPA has minor effects on carbohydrate metabolism, there are no  significant changes in lipid metabolism, fluid/nitrogen balance, blood pressure,  blood coagulation, or fibrinolysis. DMPA's disadvantages include delays in  return of fertility (up to 1 year from the date of the last injection), weight  gain due to increased appetite, and menstrual irregularities. Over 50% of  longterm DMPA users develop amenorrhea by the end of the 1st year of use and a  smaller proportion experience excessive and/or prolonged bleeding, especially in  the postpartum period. Women who express an interest in injectable contraception  should be informed about these side effects and be allowed time to ask  questions. In general, DMPA acceptors in the UK are no longer principally women  who have severe social problems, difficulties in controlling their fertility,  and an inability to follow an oral contraceptive regimen. This method is  increasingly being selected by career women who want effective contraception and  are not bothered by the side effect of amenorrhea.  PMID: 2975377 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"
