BACKGROUND: Reproductive health conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome  (PCOS), endometriosis, and uterine fibroids pose a significant burden to people  who menstruate, health care systems, and economies. Despite clinical guidelines  for each condition, prolonged delays in diagnosis are commonplace, resulting in  an increase to health care costs and risk of health complications. Symptom  checker apps have the potential to significantly reduce time to diagnosis by  providing users with health information and tools to better understand their  symptoms. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to study the prevalence and predictive importance of  self-reported symptoms of PCOS, endometriosis, and uterine fibroids, and to  explore the efficacy of 3 symptom checkers (developed by Flo Health UK Limited)  that use self-reported symptoms when screening for each condition. METHODS: Flo's symptom checkers were transcribed into separate web-based surveys  for PCOS, endometriosis, and uterine fibroids, asking respondents their  diagnostic history for each condition. Participants were aged 18 years or older,  female, and living in the United States. Participants either had a confirmed  diagnosis (condition-positive) and reported symptoms retrospectively as  experienced at the time of diagnosis, or they had not been examined for the  condition (condition-negative) and reported their current symptoms as  experienced at the time of surveying. Symptom prevalence was calculated for each  condition based on the surveys. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator  regression was used to identify key symptoms for predicting each condition.  Participants' symptoms were processed by Flo's 3 single-condition symptom  checkers, and accuracy was assessed by comparing the symptom checker output with  the participant's condition designation. RESULTS: A total of 1317 participants were included with 418, 476, and 423 in  the PCOS, endometriosis, and uterine fibroids groups, respectively. The most  prevalent symptoms for PCOS were fatigue (92%), feeling anxious (87%), BMI over  25 (84%); for endometriosis: very regular lower abdominal pain (89%), fatigue  (85%), and referred lower back pain (80%); for uterine fibroids: fatigue (76%),  bloating (69%), and changing sanitary protection often (68%). Symptoms of  anovulation and amenorrhea (long periods, irregular cycles, and absent periods),  and hyperandrogenism (excess hair on chin and abdomen, scalp hair loss, and BMI  over 25) were identified as the most predictive symptoms for PCOS, while  symptoms related to abdominal pain and the effect pain has on life, bleeding,  and fertility complications were among the most predictive symptoms for both  endometriosis and uterine fibroids. Symptom checker accuracy was 78%, 73%, and  75% for PCOS, endometriosis, and uterine fibroids, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory study characterizes self-reported symptomatology  and identifies the key predictive symptoms for 3 reproductive conditions. The  Flo symptom checkers were evaluated using real, self-reported symptoms and  demonstrated high levels of accuracy.  ©Aidan P Wickham, Yella Hewings-Martin, Frederick GB Goddard, Allison K Rodgers,  Adam C Cunningham, Carley Prentice, Octavia Wilks, Yusuf C Kaplan, Andrei  Marhol, András Meczner, Heorhi Stsefanovich, Anna Klepchukova, Liudmila  Zhaunova.

Treasure Island (FL): StatPearls Publishing; 2025  Jan–. 2023 Feb 19.  Author information: (1)MetroHealth Medical Center (2)Campbell University School of Medicine (3)Case Western Reserve Un/MetroHealth MC  Premenstrual symptoms include a constellation of mood, behavioral, and physical  indications that occur in a cyclic pattern prior to menstruation and then wane  off after the menstrual period in women of reproductive age. Most females have  only mild discomfort, and symptoms do not interfere with their personal, social,  or professional lives; however, 5% to 8% of women have moderate-to-severe  symptoms that can cause significant distress and functional impairment.   Although premenstrual symptoms have been recognized for a long time, the  diagnostic criteria have been specified only recently. The nomenclature for  premenstrual disorders has changed significantly over the years, evolving from  ""menses moodiness"" in the 18th century to ""premenstrual tension"" in the early  part of the 19th century to finally, ""premenstrual syndrome"" in the 1950s. While  some discomfort prior to menses is quite common, premenstrual syndrome (PMS)  includes the subset of women who experience symptoms that are severe enough  to impact daily activities and functioning. Late luteal dysphoric disorder  (LLDD), now known as premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), accounts for the  most severe form of PMS with the greatest impairment of women’s functioning and  perceived quality of life, often prompting them to seek treatment. Anyone who  has ovaries can have PMDD, including transgender individuals. Currently, PMDD  is listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th  Edition (DSM-5) as a separate entity under Depressive disorders, with the  criteria for diagnosis as follows: Criterion A - At least 5 of the following 11  symptoms (including at least 1 of the first 4 listed) should be present: 1.  Markedly depressed mood, feelings of hopelessness, or self-deprecating thoughts.  2. Marked anxiety, tension, feelings of being “keyed up” or “on edge”. 3. Marked  affective lability. 4. Persistent and marked anger or irritability or increased  interpersonal conflicts. 5. Decreased interest in usual activities (eg, work,  school, friends, and hobbies). 6. Subjective sense of difficulty in  concentrating. 7. Lethargy, easy fatigability, or marked lack of energy. 8.  Marked change in appetite, overeating, or specific food cravings. 9. Hypersomnia  or insomnia. 10. A subjective sense of being overwhelmed or out of control. 11.  Other physical symptoms, such as breast tenderness or swelling, headaches, joint  or muscle pain, a sensation of bloating, or weight gain. Criterion B  - symptoms  severe enough to interfere significantly with social, occupational, sexual, or  scholastic functioning. Criterion C  - symptoms discretely related to the  menstrual cycle and must not merely represent an exacerbation of the symptoms of  another disorder, such as major depressive disorder, panic disorder, dysthymic  disorder, or a personality disorder (although the symptoms may be superimposed  on those of these disorders). Criterion D - criteria A, B, and C are confirmed  by prospective daily ratings during at least 2 consecutive symptomatic menstrual  cycles. The diagnosis may be made provisionally before this confirmation.  Women with moderate-to-severe PMS or PMDD experience more quality-of-life  detriments and work-productivity losses and incur greater healthcare costs than  women with no or only mild symptoms.

Women frequently report increased bloating, flatulence, and pain during the  perimenstrual period. However, it is unknown whether women have more  intraluminal gas during menses. To evaluate whether pain-free women or women  with dysmenorrhea have different amounts of intraluminal bowel gas during the  menses, we utilized magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine colonic gas  volumes throughout the menstrual cycle. To avoid dietary influence, the  participants were instructed to avoid gas-producing foods before their scheduled  MRI. We verified the measurement repeatability across the reviewers and obtained  an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.92. There were no significant  differences in intraluminal gas volume between menses and non-menses scans (p =  0.679). Even among the women with dysmenorrhea, there was no significant  difference in the intraluminal gas volume between menses and non-menses (p =  0.753). During menstruation, the participants with dysmenorrhea had less  intraluminal gas than participants without dysmenorrhea (p = 0.044). However,  the correlation between the bowel gas volume and the pain symptoms were not  significant (p > 0.05). Although increased bowel symptoms and bloating are  reported in the women with dysmenorrhea during menses, our results do not  support the hypothesis that increased intraluminal gas is a contributing factor.  Although dietary treatment has been shown in other studies to improve menstrual  pain, the mechanism responsible for abdominal symptoms requires further  investigation. Our findings demonstrate that the intraluminal bowel gas volume  measurements are feasible and are unaffected by menses under a controlled diet.  The method described might prove helpful in future mechanistic studies in  clarifying the role of intraluminal bowel gas in other conditions.

(3)Institute for Public Health and Medicine, Northwestern University Feinberg  School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA. (4)Flo Health, Inc., Wilmington, Delaware, USA.  BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex and multi-faceted  endocrine disorder that affects 5-20% of women. Literature is limited regarding  potentially differing PCOS phenotypes among women around the world. OBJECTIVE: To use Flo app technology to understand the multifaceted  characteristics of PCOS across several countries and identify contributing risk  factors to the development of this condition. STUDY DESIGN: Flo is a widely used female health and wellbeing app with period  tracking functionality that provides a globally representative and medically  unbiased perspective on PCOS symptomatology. A chatbot dialog on PCOS was  subsequently administered on the Flo application (app) to users from 142  countries (with at least 100 respondents) who have the app running in English  during September-October 2019. RESULTS: For analyses, we selected the five countries with the greatest number  of respondents: US (n = 243,238), UK (n = 68,325), India (n = 40,092),  Philippines (n = 35,131), and Australia (n = 29,926). Bloating was the most  frequently reported symptom among PCOS-positive women and appeared to be the  main predictor of PCOS in our model (odds ratio 3·76 [95% CI 3·60-3·94];  p < 0·0001). Additional top predictors of PCOS are high blood cholesterol and  glucose levels. As BMI increased, the percentage of women who reported a  physician-confirmed PCOS diagnosis also increased. However, women in India did  not follow this trend. CONCLUSION: Our findings are based on the largest known PCOS dataset and  indicate that symptoms are more complex than previously understood. The most  frequently reported symptoms (bloating, facial hirsutism, irregular cycles,  hyperpigmentation, and baldness) are broader than those included in the  Rotterdam criteria. Future work should reevaluate and refine the criteria  utilized in PCOS diagnosis.

Introduction The constellation of the physical and psychological symptoms that  appear several days before menstrual period is regarded as the premenstrual  syndrome (PMS). The current study evaluated the symptoms associated with PMS and  their impact on the day-to-day activities of women. Methodology An observational  cross-sectional study was conducted at a squatter settlement in Karachi,  Pakistan, from January 2019 to February 2020. Amenorrheic, pregnant women, and  women who were on birth control at the time of data collection were excluded  from the study. The demographics, symptoms of PMS experienced by the  participants, and the impact of PMS symptoms on the daily lives of women were  recorded. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences v.25 (IBM Corp., Armonk,  NY) was used for data analysis.  Results The mean age ± standard deviation of  23.93 years ± 9.41 years was recorded. As many as 213 (63%) women reported  dysmenorrhea, followed by fatigue in 108 (32%), bloating in 64 (18.9%), and back  pain in 45 (13.3%) women. Irritability and anxiety were experienced by 134  (39.6%) and 117 (34.6%) women, respectively. When asked about their attitude and  perception towards menstruation, more than four-fifth respondents confessed that  they feel impure when they are experiencing their monthly period. About 38 women  (11.2%) believed that menstruation is God's way of punishing the womankind. For  the question, ""Do you feel that your normal routine is significantly disturbed  during your period?"", 40% responded in affirmation. Conclusion The findings of  the current study reflected a generally negative attitude towards menstruation,  which significantly affected the routine lives of women in our setting. The  study further concluded that dysmenorrhea, fatigue, irritability, and anxiety  were the most common symptoms of PMS experienced by women.  Copyright © 2020, Abbas et al.

Hum Reprod. 2019 Feb 1;34(2):308-322. doi: 10.1093/humrep/dey360.  Altered exploratory behaviour and increased food intake in the spiny mouse  before menstruation: a unique pre-clinical model for examining premenstrual  syndrome.  Bellofiore N(1)(2), Cousins F(1)(2), Temple-Smith P(2), Evans J(3).  Author information: (1)The Ritchie Centre, Hudson Institute of Medical Research, Clayton, Australia. (2)Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Monash University, Clayton, Australia. (3)Centre for Reproductive Health, Hudson Institute of Medical Research,  Clayton, Australia.  STUDY QUESTION: Does the newly discovered menstruating spiny mouse exhibit  behavioural and metabolic changes in correlation with premenstrual phases of the  menstrual cycle? SUMMARY ANSWER: This is the first report of cycle variability in the exploratory  and interactive behaviour, and food consumption in menstruating spiny mice, and  demonstrates that physiological changes are also dependent on within-subject  variation. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a prominent cyclic  disorder that affects millions of women worldwide. More than 70% of women endure  symptoms of impending menstruation, such as bloating, abdominal cramping and  nausea to some degree. Consequently, ~8% of women experience recurrent physical  and emotional symptoms which are extreme enough to disrupt daily life and seek  intervention. Due to a lack of an appropriate animal model, the mechanisms  underlying PMS are poorly understood, and subsequently, effective treatments are  limited. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This study analyses the changes in behavioural  responses to the investigator during vaginal lavage (n = 14), exploratory  behaviour (n = 11) and metabolism (n = 20) across the menstrual cycle in the  spiny mouse (Acomys cahirinus). PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: We performed vaginal lavages on virgin  spiny mice (6-8 months of age) and subjected each cohort of females to repeated  measures for vaginal lavage, exploratory behaviour and metabolism. Stages of the  menstrual cycle were designated as early follicular, late follicular, early  luteal, late luteal, early menstrual and late menstrual, with the late luteal  and early menstrual phases considered as premenstrual phases and analysed using  generalized estimating equations. For vaginal lavage, the behavioural responses  to researcher handling were scored on an increasing scale of severity during the  lavage process (e.g. restraint, frequency of vocalizations, total handling  time). For exploratory behaviour, exploration, memory and sociability were  assessed through subjection to Open Field (OF), Novel Object Recognition (NORT),  Social Novelty (SN) and Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) tests. For metabolism,  physiological changes were measured over a 24-h period in metabolic cages.  Results are mean ± SD with statistical significance set to P < 0.05. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Qualitative behavioural assessment showed  that compared to early follicular controls, during premenstrual phases, cycling  females had significantly increased probability of: manifesting difficulties  during restraint (4×, P < 0.01), vocalizing (8×, P < 0.01) and exhibiting  isolation in the cage (40×, P = 0.041). We saw significant increases in handling  time during the premenstrual phase in cycling females (76 ± 16 s) compared to  controls (55 ± 7 s, P < 0.001). For exploratory behaviour, cycling females in  their early menstrual phase travelled significantly less distance in the outer  zone of the OF arena (13.3 ± 9.0 m) than females in their early luteal phase  (22.3 ± 9.9 m, P = 0.038) and at significantly reduced velocities (40.2 ± 10.5  mm/s and 78.8 ± 31.0 mm/s, respectively, P = 0.006). These females also had  fewer entries into the EPM open arms during the same phases (9.6 ± 6.1 and  versus 20.0 ± 7.2, respectively, P = 0.030) and travelled less distance (3.2 ±  2.8 m versus 7.0 ± 5.5 m, respectively, P = 0.026). No differences were observed  in NORT or SN across the cycle. In the metabolism studies, spiny mice  demonstrated a significant increase in food consumption (percentage of body  weight) during the early follicular and late luteal phases (3.9 ± 2.4% and 3.8 ±  2.1%, respectively) compared to the late follicular phase (2.3 ± 2.6%, P =  0.015). LARGE SCALE DATA: N/A. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This is an observational study to determine  fundamental changes in behaviour and metabolism in a novel species, and as such,  lacks commercially available laboratory reagents and protocols specific to the  spiny mouse. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The timing of these behavioural and  physiological changes suggests that spiny mice exhibit symptoms analogous to PMS  in higher order primates, thus providing a pre-clinical model for testing novel  interventions to alleviate premenstrual symptoms and overcoming many limitations  associated with this research area.

Approximately 33% of normal-length (21⁻35 days) cycles have subclinical  ovulatory disturbances and lack sufficient progesterone, although their normal  length ensures enough estrogen. Subclinical ovulatory disturbances are related  to significant premenopausal spine bone loss (-0.86%/year). Molimina,  non-distressing premenstrual experiences, may detect ovulation within  normal-length cycles. This prospective study assessed the relationship between  molimina and ovulation. After 1-cycle of daily diary and first morning urine  collections, women answered the Molimina Question (MQ): ""Can you tell by the way  you feel that your period is coming?"" and were invited to share (a) predictive  premenstrual experience(s). A 3-fold increase in follicular-luteal pregnanediol  levels confirmed ovulation. In 610 spontaneously menstruating women (not on  hormonal contraception, mean age 31.5 ± 5.3, menarche age 12.7 ± 1.5, cycle  length [CL] 29 days, MQ positive in 89%), reported premenstrual experiences  which included negative moods (62%), cramps (48%), bloating (39%), and front  (26%) or axillary (25%) breast tenderness. Of 432 women with  pregnanediol-documented cycles, 398 (92%) were ovulatory (CL: 29 ± 5) and 34  (8%) had ovulatory disturbances (CL: 32 ± 14). Women with/without ovulatory  cycles were similar in parity, body mass index, smoking, dietary restraint and  the MQ; ovulatory-disturbed cycles were longer. Molimina did not confirm  ovulation. A non-invasive, inexpensive ovulation indicator is needed to prevent  osteoporosis.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) is a health problem which begins  approximately one week before menstruation in women occurs as a set of physical  and psychological symptoms. This study aimed to determine the effect of  aromatherapy on coping with premenstrual syndrome in university students. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial design was used. This study included 40  students in the intervention and 37 students in the control groups. Data was  collected by questionnaire form and PMS scale. The intervention and control  groups were followed up for 3 cycles in terms of PMS symptoms. The method of  inhalation aromatherapy by lavender oil was applied for 5 sessions on average  for each cycle. RESULTS: When PMS mean scores of the intervention and control groups during 3  follow-up periods were compared, it was found that there is a statistically  significant difference between intervention and control groups (p<0.05). It was  determined that there is a statistically significant difference between the  groups in terms of PMS scale and sub-dimensions of anxiety, depressive affect,  nervousness, pain, bloating, depressive thoughts mean scores of pre-test and 3rd  follow-up (p<0.05), CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that inhalation aromatherapy  can be used for coping with PMS.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of the ISY study was to investigate the prevalence of  menstrual-related symptoms prior to and/or during menstrual or withdrawal  bleeding among women from 12 European countries. METHODS: A 15-min quantitative online survey was conducted in two waves from  February to September 2015 among 5728 women aged between 18 and 45 years, with  an equal distribution of women using a combined hormonal contraceptive,  including regular combined oral contraceptives (COCs) (CHC group, n = 2739) and  women using a non-hormonal contraceptive or no contraceptive (non-HC group,  n = 2989). RESULTS: The prevalence of at least one menstrual-related symptom was high in  CHC users (93%) and in non-HC users (95%) (p < .0001) and the average number of  symptoms reported was 5.3 vs. 5.9, respectively, (p < .0001). Pelvic pain,  bloating/swelling, irritability and mood swing were reported in more than half  of the women in both groups. Although generally modest, symptom severity was  higher in non-HC users, except for headache. Overall, during the last four  cycles, 60-75% of women did not require a treatment for most symptoms but  headaches and pelvic pain. Mood swings/irritability, water retention/weight  gain, lack of energy/mood swings and lack of energy/irritability were common  symptoms that frequently co-occurred. No associations were reported between  symptoms and age, educational qualifications or women's desire to reduce the  frequency of menstruation. CONCLUSIONS: Premenstrual and menstrual symptomatology was less frequent, less  numerous and less severe (except for headache) in women using CHCs; however, it  remains a common concern. Reducing the frequency of menstrual periods could  reduce withdrawal-related symptoms.  DOI: 10.1080/13625187.2017.1400001 PMID: 29157023 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to assess the level of inconvenience associated with  monthly bleeding, determine how many women would prefer a bleeding frequency of  less than once a month, and what would motivate their choice. METHODS: A 15-min quantitative online survey was carried out among 2883 women  aged between 18 and 45 years in six European countries (Austria, Belgium,  France, Italy, Poland and Spain). RESULTS: Of those surveyed, 1319 women used a combined hormonal contraceptive  (CHC group) and 1564 used a non-hormonal contraceptive or no contraceptive  (non-HC group). The menstrual period was significantly longer (5 vs. 4.5 days),  heavier (16% vs. 8% heavy menstrual flow) and associated with more symptoms (6.1  vs. 5.6) in non-HC users than in CHC users (p < 0.0001). More than half of the  women in each group reported pelvic pain, bloating/swelling, mood swings and  irritability, but the rate was significantly higher in the non-HC group. Given  the choice, 57% of women in both groups said they would opt for longer intervals  between periods. Sexuality, social life, work and sporting activities were key  factors affecting their decision. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of women would prefer to have menstrual periods less  than once a month, with a frequency ranging from once every 3 months to no  periods at all. This can be explained by the desire to avoid the unpleasant  aspects of menstruation and its negative impact on private and professional  life.

Martin VT(1), Ballard J, Diamond MP, Mannix LK, Derosier FJ, Lener SE, Krishen  A, McDonald SA.  Author information: (1)1 Division of Internal Medicine, University of Cincinnati Medical Center ,  Cincinnati, Ohio.  BACKGROUND: Dysmenorrhea and menstrual migraine may share a common pathogenic  pathway. Both appear to be mediated, in part, by an excess of prostaglandin  production that occurs during menstruation. METHODS: Data were pooled from two replicate randomized controlled trials of 621  adult menstrual migraineurs with dysmenorrhea who treated migraine with  sumatriptan-naproxen or placebo. Along with headache symptoms, nonpain menstrual  symptoms (bloating, fatigue, and irritability) and menstrual pain symptoms  (abdominal and back pain) were recorded at the time periods of 30 minutes and 1,  2, 4, and 4-24 hours. Relief of menstrual symptoms was compared using a  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. Logistic regression was used to determine the odds  of a headache response with increasing numbers of moderate to severe  dymenorrheic symptoms. RESULTS: Sumatriptan-naproxen was superior to placebo for relief of tiredness,  irritability, and abdominal pain at the time periods of 2, 4, and 4-24 hours  (p≤0.023); back pain at the time periods of 4 and 4-24 hours (p≤0.023); and  bloating at 4-24 hours endpoint (p=0.01). The odds ratios (ORs) of attaining  migraine pain freedom for 2 hours and for sustained 2-24 hours decreased as  moderate to severe dysmenorrhea symptoms increased with sumatriptan-naproxen  versus placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with sumatriptan-naproxen may provide relief of menstrual  symptoms and migraine in female migraineurs with dysmenorrhea. The presence of  moderate to severe dysmenorrhea symptoms is associated with decreased response  rates for menstrual migraine, suggesting that the co-occurrence of these  disorders may negatively impact the results of migraine-abortive therapy.

Hormone withdrawal-associated symptoms: overlooked and under-explored.  Bitzer J(1).  Author information: (1)Frauenklinik, Universitätsspital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.  Johannes.Bitzer@usb.ch  Women using combined oral contraceptives (COCs) report hormone  withdrawal-associated symptoms (HWaS), including bloating, headaches and pelvic  pain, which might be due to withdrawal of exogenous hormones and fluctuations in  endogenous estrogen during the hormone-free interval (HFI). The prevalence of  HWaS is not yet well studied, but these symptoms may lead to reduced user  satisfaction and quality of life, and sub-optimal adherence to, and  discontinuation of, COCs. HWaS are often confused with treatment-related adverse  events because the timing of symptom occurrence is seldom considered.  Publications on HWaS are lacking, with few guidelines and no clear consensus on  the best treatment option(s). Reported treatments include continuous or extended  hormonal COC regimens, which extend the time of the active hormone. Although  extended-cycle regimens can cause unpredictable bleeding patterns, user  satisfaction is high, with several studies reporting improvement in HWaS.  Shortening the HFI is also a well-tolerated and effective method of reducing  HWaS, and confers a more predictable bleeding pattern than extending the active  hormone period. This may improve acceptance and long-term use of COCs. Future  prospects include estradiol-based contraceptive combinations with a shortened  HFI and more stable estradiol levels throughout the menstrual cycle.

White CP(1), Hitchcock CL, Vigna YM, Prior JC.  Author information: (1)McMaster University Medical Centre, 1280 Main Street West, Hamilton, ON,  Canada L8S 4L8.  We report menstrual and mid-cycle patterns of self-reported ""fluid retention"" in  765 menstrual cycles in 62 healthy women. Self-reported ""fluid retention,""  commonly described as bloating, is one element of the clinical assessment and  diagnosis of premenstrual symptoms. These daily diary data were collected as  part of an observational prospective one-year study of bone changes in healthy  women of differing exercise characteristics. Ovulation was documented by  quantitative basal temperature analysis, and serum estradiol and progesterone  levels were available from initial and final cycles. Fluid retention scores (on  a 0-4 scale) peaked on the first day of menstrual flow (mean ± SE : 0.9 ± 0.1),  were lowest during the mid-follicular period, and gradually increased from 0.22  ± 0.05 to 0.50 ± 0.09 over the 11 days surrounding ovulation. Mid-cycle, but not  premenstrual, fluid scores tended to be lower in anovulatory cycles (ANOVA P =  0.065), and scores were higher around menstruation than at midcycle (P <  0.0001). Neither estradiol nor progesterone levels were significantly associated  with fluid retention scores. The peak day of average fluid retention was the  first day of flow. There were no significant differences in women's  self-perceived fluid retention between ovulatory and anovulatory cycles.  DOI: 10.1155/2011/138451 PMCID: PMC3154522 PMID: 21845193"

[Article in Russian]  Bykova SV, Sabel'nikova EA, Parfenov AI, Gudkova RB, Krums LM, Chikunova BZ.  Violation of reproductive function in patients with celiac disease can manifest  as delayed puberty, infertility, amenorrhea, premature menopause, spontaneous  abortion, low birth weight. The aim of the study was to establish the frequency  and nature of reproductive function violation in patients with CD in the Russian  Federation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 132 women (average age 38,5 +/- 1,17  years) with CD observed in CSRIG in the period from 2000 to 2010. Comparison  group consisted 105 women (average age 38,7 +/- 1,6 years) with predominantly  functional bowel disorders (irritable bowel syndrome, functional constipation,  functional bloating, inert colon). Were took into account information regarding  obstetric history, physical and laboratory signs of malabsorption syndrome (MS)  study of antibodies to alpha-gliadin immunoglobulin (IG) A class (AGA) and  tissue transglutaminase (AtTG). RESULTS: The average age of onset of menses was 14,3 +/- 1,4 years, and in the  control group - 13,0 +/- 1,3 years (p > 0.05), half of patients with C (43.9%)  had menstruation begun at age 15 years and older, while 7.6% of the women--aged  17 and older. In the comparison group menses beginning after 15 years was only  at 13.3% of women. In 61.3% of patients with CD was irregular menstrual cycle  while in the comparison group such violations were noted in 13.3% (p < 0.001).  Prolonged periods of amenorrhea we observed in women with newly diagnosed GC 3  times more likely than the comparison group: 43.9% and 11.4% respectively (p <  0.01). They also had nearly 3 times more likely to occur spontaneous  miscarriage: at 46.9% and 14.3% respectively (p < 0.01). The frequency of dead  children birth was about the same: 2.3% and 1.9% respectively (p > 0.05). The  frequency of reproductive disorders increased with the growth of the severity of  MS. In 43% of women after 6-8 months of strict adherence to a gluten-free diet  (GFD) had disappeared amenorrhea and there were regular menses. Three women of  childbearing age, strictly abided the GFD and had a history of repeated  spontaneous abortion during the year managed to get pregnant and give birth to  healthy full-term baby. CONCLUSIONS: Reproductive disorders in women with celiac disease are  significantly more likely than at women with functional bowel disease. One of  the reasons of reproductive disorders in patients with CD can be malabsorption  of necessary nutrients in the small intestine. The presence of reproductive  disorders should be considered as a risk factor for celiac disease, so these  women should be screened for celiac disease.  PMID: 21695947 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Author information: (1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer,  Israel. dseidman@tau.ac.il  BACKGROUND: Continuous use of combined oral contraceptives is currently  attracting growing interest as a means of improving menstrual related symptoms  and reducing the number of bleeding days. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate bleeding patterns, menstrual symptoms and quality of  life with an extended 84/7 oral contraceptive regimen versus 21/7 cycles. METHODS: In two consecutive run-in cycles, 30 microg ethinyl estradiol and 3 mg  drospirenone tablets taken on days 1-21 were followed by a tablet-free period  from days 22 to 28 of each cycle and then by two 84 day cycles of pill use with  a 7 day tablet-free interval. The primary outcome was the total number of  bleeding/spotting days. Secondary outcomes were severity of daily symptoms,  general well-being determined by the PGWBI questionnaire, and overall treatment  satisfaction. RESULTS: Of the 137 women invited to participate in the study 109 (aged 18-40  years) were enrolled. The number of bleeding days decreased by about one-third  from a calculated 31.8 days of bleeding under a cyclic 21/7 regimen to an  expected total of 21.8 days for the extended 84/7 regimen. The incidence of  menorrhagia, intermenstrual bleeding, dysmenorrhea, abdominal bloating, breast  tenderness, depressive moods and irritability - when compared at enrollment and  at the end of the second extended study period--was significantly lower (P <  0.005) among women on the continuous pill regimen. The median (range) global  PGWBI scores were not substantially different before and after the extended use  cycles: 78.2 (39.1-96.4) and 77.3 (30.9-96.4), respectively. Body weight and  skin condition also remained constant. At the completion of the study: 65.5% of  the women were either highly satisfied (41.4%) or satisfied (24.1%) with the  extended regimen. CONCLUSIONS: The extended 84/7 regimen was found to be satisfactory for the  majority of participants and was associated with a decrease in the number of  bleeding days and an improvement in menstrual symptoms compared to 21/7 cycles.

Author information: (1)Dipartimento di Psicologia DPSS, Università Degli Studi di Padova, via  Venezia 8, 35131 Padova, Italy. jeff.kiesner@unipd.it  The associations between physical and psychological symptoms of the menstrual  cycle have not been carefully studied in past research, but may lead to a better  understanding of the underlying mechanisms of these symptoms. The present study  examines the day-to-day co-variations among physical and psychological symptoms  of the menstrual cycle. These symptoms were evaluated on a daily basis across  one entire menstrual cycle, with a non-clinical sample of 92 university  students. Results showed that headaches, gastrointestinal problems, lower  abdominal bloating, skin changes, and breast changes, were all significantly  associated with higher levels of psychological symptoms; whereas back and joint  pain, lower abdominal cramps, cervical mucous, and menstrual flow, were not  associated with psychological symptoms. However, significant differences in  these associations were observed across individuals for back and joint pain,  headaches, lower abdominal cramps, skin changes, and menstrual flow: Whereas  some women demonstrated higher levels of psychological symptoms associated with  these physical symptoms, other women demonstrated lower levels of psychological  symptoms. Finally, correlations among the associations between physical and  psychological symptoms (slopes) demonstrated clear differences across the  different physical symptoms. These results indicate that, although higher levels  of some physical symptoms are associated with higher levels of psychological  symptoms, there are significant differences in the magnitude and direction of  these relations across individuals. Further consideration of physical symptoms  may provide useful information for understanding individual differences in  symptom profiles and response to steroid fluctuations, and for improving  differential diagnosis and treatment planning and evaluation.

Communicating with patients about extended-cycle and continuous use of oral  contraceptives.  Nelson AL(1).  Author information: (1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, David Geffen School of Medicine at  UCLA, Torrance, California 90509-2910, USA. AnitaLNelson@earthlink.net  Oral contraceptives (OCs) have been the gold standard for contraception in the  United States since their introduction in 1960. They are used for both their  contraceptive and noncontraceptive benefits. Although the traditional dosing  regimen, 21 active pills and 7 placebo pills, (21/7), reduces many symptoms  women suffer with spontaneous cycles, hormone withdrawal symptoms often occur  during the 7-day hormone-free interval. New contraceptives are available that  decrease the number of hormone-free days each cycle or that increase the time  between hormone-free intervals. These changes in packaging are expected to  decrease the periodic hormone fluctuations experienced by OC users. Because  routine use of extended-cycle/continuous OCs is relatively new and differs from  what women have been told for years about the importance of monthly bleeding,  women have many questions about and even significant reluctance to using these  methods. Numerous studies have shown that extended-cycle and continuous OC use  are safe and effective. Total bleeding episodes are reduced, as are problems  with bloating and dysmenorrhea. Women usually experience more unscheduled  spotting and bleeding in the initial cycles, but those problems decrease with  longer use. Amenorrhea may be beneficial and suit the lifestyles of many women.  Counseling women about all their contraceptive options and the variety of ways  that OCs can be taken may increase women's commitment to correct use and  increase efficacy. Good clinician-patient communication, which includes creating  an open dialogue with the patient to discuss her individual risks and benefits,  should lead to more successful contraceptive utilization.

[Article in Bulgarian]  Chernev T(1), Ivanov S, Sirakov M.  Author information: (1)Univ. Ob. & Gyn. Hospital, Sofia, Bulgaria.  Data are presented from an investigation of the use of monophasic contraceptive  pills chosen by different age groups. Analyses are made of the data obtained  from the Bulgarian Association for Family Planning (BAFP) card index for the  last two years. Information is given on the number of observed cycles, type of  applied contraceptive pill, aims of their application (contraception, treatment  of acne, menstrual disturbances etc.), age of patients, as well as any possible  adverse effects--change in blood pressure, bodyweight changes, intermenstrual  bleeding, hairiness, breast problems, paraclinical changes, etc. The observed  cycles show a very small percentage of adverse effects with hormonal  contraception, mainly during the first 2 or 3 cycles, with predominance of  intermenstrual bleeding. No bodyweight changes or increased hairiness were  observed.  PIP: The data for this analysis were obtained from the records of the Bulgarian  Association for Family Planning (BAFP); the data covered a period of 3 years and  were for 593 women with a total menstrual cycle of 3132. The most frequently  used monophasic oral contraceptives were Cilest (containing norgestimate and  ethinyl estradiol), used by 233 women, Marvelon (containing desogestrel and  ethinyl estradiol), used by 154 women, Microgynon FE, used by 117 women, and  Nordette (containing levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol), used by 89 women.  The preparations were used mainly for contraception, but some women used them  for menstrual regulation (27 women used Nordette for this purpose and so did 25  women use Marvelon for such a purpose), and a small percentage of the women used  them for used dysmenorrhea. 103 (43.2%) women who used Cilest were in the 14-19  age group, while 106 (45.4%) of them were in the 20-25 age group. In the 14-19  age group 20 (17.2%) used Microgynon, 18 (20.2%) used Nordette, and 60 (38.8%)  relied on Marvelon. In the 20-25 age group the respective figures were 79  (67.2%) for Microgynon, 40 (44.9%) for Nordette, and 67 (42.5%) for Marvelon.  Some of the unfavorable metabolic effects of oral contraceptives included the  increase of LDL and the reduction of HDL levels and androgenic effects. The most  frequent side effect was intermenstrual bleeding, of which there were 19 cases  for Cilest, 7 for Microgynon, 5 for Nordette, and 11 for Marvelon. Menstruation  was prolonged in 4 women using Cilest and in 5 using Marvelon. 5 women using  Cilest, 2 using Microgynon, and 2 using Nordette had headache. Other adverse  effects included episodes of galactorrhea, discomfort, mastopathy, and bloating  in the stomach. These effects did not pose a risk to general or reproductive  health and did not justify discontinuation of use for these preparations.  PMID: 9859526 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

A study of the association between squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma in  the lung, and history of menstruation in Shanghai women, China.  Liao ML(1), Wang JH, Wang HM, Ou AQ, Wang XJ, You WQ.  Author information: (1)Shanghai Chest Hospital, China.  The menstrual history of 162 cases of female lung adenocarcinoma and 19 cases of  squamous cell carcinoma was compared with 187 age-matched female controls, and  analyzed for statistical significant differences that may exist between the two  groups using the Epi-infor program, the Chi-square test, and the Bartlett test  for homogeneity of variance. Parameters related to menstrual history included:  age of menarche, menstrual cycle, number of days of menstrual period, amount of  menstrual flow, menstrual pain, breast bloating/tenderness, and total number of  menstrual cycles prior to menopause or diagnosis of lung cancer. The results  show that cases of squamous cell carcinoma have a higher total number of  menstrual cycles than controls, raising the possibility that estrogen may play a  role in the induction of squamous cell carcinoma. Cases with adenocarcinoma were  found to have shorter menstrual periods than controls, suggesting that activity  of the corpus luteum may be related to the occurrence of adenocarcinoma.  Progesterone (PR) and estrogen (ER) receptor levels were also measured in 21  adenocarcinoma surgical specimens. A positive ER and PR receptor expression was  correlated with later menarche and earlier menopause.  DOI: 10.1016/s0169-5002(96)90224-x PMID: 8785664 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"
2224376,Factors related to self-reporting of the pre-menstrual syndrome.,"Warner P, Bancroft J","1. Br J Psychiatry. 1990 Aug;157:249-60. doi: 10.1192/bjp.157.2.249.  Factors related to self-reporting of the pre-menstrual syndrome.  Warner P(1), Bancroft J.  Author information: (1)MRC Reproductive Biology Unit, Edinburgh.  Menstrual health questionnaires were completed by a self-selected sample of the  readership of a woman's magazine (n = 5457). Sixty-one per cent of subjects  described themselves as suffering from pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS) and this was  largely corroborated by ratings of symptoms pre-menstrually, menstrually and  post-menstrually for the most recent cycle. Mood symptoms were more strongly  implicated than physical ones. Self-report of PMS was found to be modestly  associated with aspects of parity and oral contraceptive use, but strongly and  positively related to the duration of 'natural' menstrual cycles (i.e.  uninterrupted by pregnancy or steroidal contraception) and to psychosocial  stress. There were interactions among psychosocial factors and between  psychosocial load and duration of natural cycles.  PIP: Studies of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) have identified so many systems and  associated factors that it is difficult to assess whether PMS is a discrete  entity or encompasses a variety of cyclical phenomenon with differing  etiologies. A heuristic, retrospective study of PMS was conducted among 5457  readers of a UK women's magazine who mailed in a menstrual health questionnaire  that focused on the most recent menstrual period. 61% of respondents indicated  that they were currently suffering from PMS, 32% were uncertain, and 7% did not  experience PMS. Mood symptoms, reported by 65%, included irritability (65%),  anger for no apparent reason (64%), and easily upset (60%). Of the physical  symptoms, the most prevalent were abdominal bloating (45%) and breast tenderness  (40%). There was a remission of mood and physical disturbances postmenstrually  in 79% and 94% of sufferers, respectively. Oral contraceptive (OC) users were  significantly less likely to report PMS than nonusers, especially nulliparous  users. In addition, there was a generally trend for PMS to increase in  prevalence with increasing age. More significant was the finding that, the  longer a woman has been experiencing menstrual cycles uninterrupted by pregnancy  or unmodified by OC use, the more likely she is to self-report PMS. After 6  years of natural cycles, there was a higher prevalence of PMS among women with a  high psychosocial stress level. In women with no psychosocial ""load,"" PMS is  most prevalent in nulliparous women and after 2 years of natural cycles. These  findings suggest that PMS may persist as a result of biological sensitivity to  premenstrual changes, possibly interacting with psychosocial factors. Further  research will focus on measures of the severity of PMS clinical symptoms and  patterns of symptom change.  DOI: 10.1192/bjp.157.2.249 PMID: 2224376 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

PIP: 1769 women studied for 4 years by the Fertility and Sterility Research  Center in Mexico City received .5 mg chlormadinone acetate as a contraceptive  from Day 5-25 of the cycle for a total of 28,158 cycles. 1070 endometrial  biopsies were performed at different periods in the therapy for up to 52 weeks.  Secretory endometrium occurred between 67.4-79.7% indicating treatment doesn't  markedly interfere with endometrial glandular development. Cervical mucus,  studied between Days 9 and 16 of the cycle showed physico-chemical changes  preventing sperm penetration (80%) with good penetration present in 5%. Thus  progestogen does not act through interference or inhibition of ovulation in the  majority. Side effects included breakthrough bleeding (20% in cycles 1-6; 10% by  cycle 9), headache 14.4% (control 1-12%) and bloating of lower abdomen (11%).  .5mg chlormadinone acetate has proven toleration for up to 4 years.
