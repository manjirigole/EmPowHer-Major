Weight loss can positively alter female physiology; however, whether dietary  carbohydrate- or fat- restriction confer unique effects is less studied.  Precisely designed, hypocaloric well-formulated ketogenic diets (KD; ~75% energy  for weight maintenance) were compared to isocaloric/isonitrogenous low-fat diet  (LFD) on self-reported menses in pre-menopausal overweight and obese women (mean  ± SD: 34 ± 10 years, BMI: 32.3 ± 2.7 kg/m2). Women received a precisely-weighed  and formulated KD with either twice-daily with ketone salts (KS; n = 6) or a  flavor-matched placebo (PL; n = 7) daily for six-weeks. An age and BMI-matched  cohort (n = 6) was later assigned to the LFD and underwent the same testing  procedures as the KD. Self-reported menses fluctuations were assessed bi-weekly  along with measures of body weight, body composition, and fasting serum clinical  chemistries using repeated measures ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc corrections.  Both diets elicited clinically-significant weight-loss (Δ: -7.0 ± 0.5 kg; p <  0.001), primarily from fat-mass (Δ: -4.6 ± 0.3 kg; p < 0.001), and improved  insulin-sensitivity and serum lipids (all p < 0.05). Fasting plasma glucose and  inflammatory markers were not different between diets. Fasting capillary  beta-hydroxybutyrate (R-βHB) increased significantly during the KD, independent  of supplementation (Δ: 1.2 ± 0.3 mM R-βHB; p < 0.001). Women randomized to the  KD+KS (30%) and KD+PL (43%) reported subjective increases in menses frequency  and intensity after 14 days, whereas another third reported a regain of menses  (>1 year since the last period) after 28 days. No LFD participants reported  menses changes. Nutrient-dense, whole-food KDs and LFD improved weight, BMI,  body composition, and blood parameters in pre-menopausal women after six-weeks.  Changes in self-reported menses were described by most of the KD participants,  but none of the LFD women suggesting there may be unique effects of nutritional  ketosis, independent of weight loss.

Female wrestling has grown exponentially over the past decade. Within the United  States, 46 states now recognize female high school wrestling, and 153 colleges  have programs. It is on track to become an NCAA championship-level sport in  2026. A primary health and safety risk among this cohort pertains to rapid  weight loss strategies. These can lead to intentional caloric restriction and  decreased body fatness, with the perceived goal of attaining a competitive  advantage. Low energy availability and low body fatness are associated with a  number of health concerns including menstrual dysfunction and loss of bone  mineral density in girls and women. The current recommendation of 12% as a  minimum for percentage body fat is very likely too low, opening the door for  health perturbations among this population. The minimum threshold might more  appropriately fall within the range of 18% to 20%. Body fat assessment methods,  primarily skinfold measures that are used to guide weight class selection, have  not been adequately validated among this population and therefore should be an  area of research focus, while also exploring alternative assessment techniques.  Further, we recommend that weight cycling, restrictive energy intake, and  intentional dehydration be avoided. Research should assess the effects of  frequent weight cycling (to ""make weight"") and prolonged periods of low body fat  on the reproductive and bone health of these athletes. Finally, research and  clinical evaluations on female wrestlers are limited, and we offer a list of  research priorities for future investigation into this contemporary issue.

Witkoś J(1), Luberda E(1), Błażejewski G(1), Strój E(1).  Author information: (1)Faculty of Medicine and Health Science, Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski Krakow  University, Kraków, Poland.  Physique competitions are weight-sensitive sports in which stage presentation,  aesthetic appearance and posing ability of the athletes are judged rather than  physical performance. The aim of this study was to assess low energy  availability among female physique athletes by using the LEAF-Q. The study  involved 104 females who were physique athletes. Monthly cycle disorders were  reported in 58.65% of the women, that is periods stopped for three consecutive  months or longer (amenorrhea). This situation occurred before the research was  conducted in 43.27% of athletes and during the research in 15.38%. The physique  athletes claimed that menstruation changes occurred when there was an increased  exercise intensity, frequency or duration. Absence from training due to injury  was reported by 27.88% of the women. The LEAF-Q identified 46.15% of the  physique athletes as at risk (score ≥ 8) of low energy availability and the  physiological consequences related to RED-S. Women who had menstrual cycle  disorders were younger and did more training per week. Among women with  menstrual disorders, cramps or stomach ache which cannot be related to  menstruation occurred more frequently (p = 0.004). Absence from training or lack  of participation in competition due to injuries occurred more frequently in the  score ≥ 8 group (p = 0.024) thank the ≤ score 8 group. In the score ≥ 8 group  menstruation changes, that is less bleeding or cessation of menstruation (p =  0.035), occurred more frequently when there was an increase in exercise  intensity, frequency or duration (p = 0.002).

Female endurance athletes are considered a high-risk group for developing  Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (REDs). Due to the lack of educational and  behavioral intervention studies, targeting and evaluating the effects of the  practical daily management of REDs, we developed the Food and nUtrition for  Endurance athletes-a Learning (FUEL) program, consisting of 16 weekly online  lectures and individual athlete-centered nutrition counseling every other week.  We recruited female endurance athletes from Norway (n = 60), Sweden (n = 84),  Ireland (n = 17), and Germany (n = 47). Fifty athletes with symptoms of REDs and  with low risk of eating disorders, with no use of hormonal contraceptives and no  chronic diseases, were allocated to either the FUEL intervention (n = 32) (FUEL)  or a 16-week control period (n = 18) (CON). All but one completed FUEL, while 15  completed CON. We found strong evidence for improvements in sports nutrition  knowledge, assessed via interviews, and moderate to strong evidence in the  ratings concerning self-perceived sports nutrition knowledge in FUEL versus CON.  Analyses of the seven-day prospective weighed food record and questions related  to sports nutrition habits, suggested weak evidence for improvements in FUEL  versus CON. The FUEL intervention improved sports nutrition knowledge and  suggested weak evidence for improved sports nutrition behavior in female  endurance athletes with symptoms of REDs.

Where do you go when your periods go?: A case-study examining secondary  amenorrhea in a professional internationally-capped female soccer player through  the lens of the sport nutritionist.

(3)Musculoskeletal Physiology Research Group, Sport Health and Performance  Enhancement Research Centre, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, UK.  This case study follows a professional internationally capped female soccer  player's two-year journey from eumenorrhea, through injury, to amenorrhea, and  the challenges faced by the player and nutritionist. The two years are split  into three sections: (Areta et al. 2013) longitudinal profiling of the player,  (Baker et al. 2020) nutrition to support her return from injury, and (Beato et  al. 2018) investigation into the observed secondary amenorrhea. The cause of  amenorrhea was investigated through the assessment of energy availability via  doubly labelled water, remote food photography, blood biomarkers and resting  metabolic rate. Despite having secondary amenorrhea and anovulatory cycles, the  player did not have low energy availability. This study shows the importance for  practitioner's, particularly nutritionists, to not assume that all menstrual  irregularities are caused by low energy availability and could be caused by a  combination of factors (e.g., clinical, physiological, and psychological), which  requires a multi-disciplinary investigation and intervention team. This study  also showed that education needs to be provided about menstrual health to elite  female soccer players as the player (i) believed that not having a period was  beneficial for performance and unsure of possible health implications; (ii) was  convinced that a one-day bleed indicated a regular menstrual cycle; and (iii)  was reluctant to waste the practitioners time discussing menstrual issues and  was nervous of finding out if she had an actual health issue. It is therefore  crucial that players feel comfortable in discussing their menstrual status with  practitioners to support their performance and long-term health.

35839365,Care of the Active Female.,"Wojnowich K, Dhani R","1. Am Fam Physician. 2022 Jul;106(1):52-60.  Care of the Active Female.  Wojnowich K, Dhani R.  Physical activity has many health-related benefits, including prevention and  management of chronic disease, weight management, and improved mental health.  Active girls and women of all ages and abilities are at risk of relative energy  deficiency in sport, a syndrome encompassing low energy availability, menstrual  irregularities, and disordered bone metabolism. Presence of amenorrhea or  oligomenorrhea may suggest reduced energy availability. Active females are at  risk of overuse injuries, including patellofemoral pain syndrome, iliotibial  band syndrome, and stress fractures; treatment usually includes activity  modification, a period of rest, and physical therapy. Active females are also at  risk of acute injuries, including concussion and anterior cruciate ligament  injuries. Pregnant patients without contraindications who were physically active  before pregnancy can continue these activities, and those who were not  previously active may gradually increase their activity level to a goal of 150  minutes per week. Moderate exercise during pregnancy reduces the risk of  gestational diabetes mellitus, preeclampsia, and cesarean delivery. Postpartum  exercise focused on core and pelvic floor strengthening can improve pelvic floor  dysfunction. Supervised exercise programs focused on strength and balance have  been consistently shown to reduce the risk of falls and injurious falls in older  women.  PMID: 35839365 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

(4)Laboratory of Fertility and Well-Being, Max Planck Institute for Demographic  Research, 18057 Rostock, Germany.  The contraceptive effect of breastfeeding remains essential to controlling  fertility in many developing regions of the world. The extent to which this  negative effect of breastfeeding on ovarian activity is sensitive to ecological  conditions, notably maternal energetic status, has remained controversial. We  assess the relationship between breastfeeding duration and postpartum amenorrhea  (the absence of menstruation following a birth) in 17 World Fertility Surveys  and 284 Demographic Health Surveys conducted between 1975 and 2019 in 84 low-  and middle-income countries. We then analyze the resumption of menses in women  during unsupplemented lactation. We find that a sharp weakening of the  breastfeeding-postpartum amenorrhea relationship has globally occurred over the  time period analyzed. The slope of the breastfeeding-postpartum amenorrhea  relationship is negatively associated with development: higher values of the  Human Development Index, urbanization, access to electricity, easier access to  water, and education are predictive of a weaker association between  breastfeeding and postpartum amenorrhea. Low parity also predicts shorter  postpartum amenorrhea. The association between exclusive breastfeeding and  maintenance of amenorrhea in the early postpartum period is also found in rapid  decline in Asia and in moderate decline in sub-Saharan Africa. These findings  indicate that the effect of breastfeeding on ovarian function is partly mediated  by external factors that likely include negative maternal energy balance and  support the notion that prolonged breastfeeding significantly helps control  fertility only under harsh environmental conditions.

Advancement in female sports medicine and preventive medicine.  Nose-Ogura S(1).  Author information: (1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo,  Japan.  Sport plays a major role in maintaining and improving physical function and  health of women from adolescence to sexual maturity, through to menopause and  old age, and it also plays a key role in social productivity and medicine from  the perspective of preventive medicine. However, in routine clinical practice,  there are many gynecological problems that affect the condition and performance  of female athletes due to a lack of appropriate medical intervention, such as  neglect of amenorrhea and menstruation-related symptoms. In addition, the number  of athletes aiming to return to competition post-partum has been increasing in  recent years, but there is little medical data on the well-being of female  athletes during pregnancy and the post-partum period. I previously conducted  clinical research on three separate topics, with the aim of clarifying the  current issues unique to female athletes, mainly in terms of conditioning and  injury prevention. The goal was that clinical research was to examine the  situation of athletes with and without disabilities and provide feedback from  the survey results to athletes and coaches. This paper divides the clinical  studies conducted to date into three topics that will be explored herein: (i)  research on the female athlete triad (Triad); (ii) research on oral  contraceptives/low-dose estrogen-progestin; and (iii) research on pregnancy and  post-partum period.  © 2020 Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

Author information: (1)Women's Health and Exercise Lab, Department of Kinesiology, College of Health  and Human Development, The Pennsylvania State University, PA 16803, USA.  We (i) identified alternative scoring strategies for the Female Athlete Triad  Coalition cumulative risk assessment (CRA) tool to be utilized when particular  risk factors (bone mineral density (BMD), oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea) cannot be  determined; (ii) objectively defined dietary restriction for use in the CRA  tool; and (iii) explored proxy measures of energy deficiency. This  cross-sectional investigation of exercising women (n = 166) utilized an existing  database derived from multiple studies designed to assess health, exercise, and  menstrual function. Data from the screening/baseline period of each study  included: anthropometrics, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, disordered eating  questionnaires, descriptive data, and proxy measures of energy deficiency (total  triiodothyronine (TT3) and ratio of measured-to-predicted resting metabolic rate  (mRMR/pRMR)). Substituting delayed menarche for BMD was the best-fit replacement  resulting in 15 (9%) participants being categorized in different clearance  categories. When menstrual status cannot be assessed, such as during hormonal  contraceptive use, low energy availability (EA) determined using self-report and  disordered eating questionnaires was the best substitution, resulting in 34  (20%) participants being categorized in different clearance categories. Based on  original clearance categorizations, the provisional group had lower TT3 (78.3 ±  2.2 ng/dL; 92.7 ± 2.7 ng/dL) and Harris-Benedict mRMR/pRMR (0.85 ± 0.01; 0.90 ±  0.01) than the full group. Until an updated risk assessment tool is developed,  delayed menarche can substitute for low BMD and low EA for  oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea. Novelty This investigation addresses previous  limitations of the Triad CRA tool. Disordered eating questionnaires can be used  to objectively identify dietary restriction for the low EA risk factor. When a  risk factor cannot be assessed, delayed menarche can substitute for low BMD and  low EA for oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea.  DOI: 10.1139/apnm-2020-0131 PMID: 32502379 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"
31941004,Menopause-Associated Lipid Metabolic Disorders and Foods Beneficial for Postmenopausal Women.,"Ko SH, Kim HS","1. Nutrients. 2020 Jan 13;12(1):202. doi: 10.3390/nu12010202.  Menopause-Associated Lipid Metabolic Disorders and Foods Beneficial for  Postmenopausal Women.  Ko SH(1), Kim HS(1).  Author information: (1)Department of Food and Nutrition, College of Human Ecology, Sookmyung Women's  University, Seoul 04310, Korea.  Menopause is clinically diagnosed as a condition when a woman has not  menstruated for one year. During the menopausal transition period, there is an  emergence of various lipid metabolic disorders due to hormonal changes, such as  decreased levels of estrogens and increased levels of circulating androgens;  these may lead to the development of metabolic syndromes including  cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. Dysregulation of lipid metabolism  affects the body fat mass, fat-free mass, fatty acid metabolism, and various  aspects of energy metabolism, such as basal metabolic ratio, adiposity, and  obesity. Moreover, menopause is also associated with alterations in the levels  of various lipids circulating in the blood, such as lipoproteins,  apolipoproteins, low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), high-density lipoproteins  (HDL) and triacylglycerol (TG). Alterations in lipid metabolism and excessive  adipose tissue play a key role in the synthesis of excess fatty acids,  adipocytokines, proinflammatory cytokines, and reactive oxygen species, which  cause lipid peroxidation and result in the development of insulin resistance,  abdominal adiposity, and dyslipidemia. This review discusses dietary  recommendations and beneficial compounds, such as vitamin D, omega-3 fatty  acids, antioxidants, phytochemicals-and their food sources-to aid the management  of abnormal lipid metabolism in postmenopausal women.

PURPOSE: We aimed to explore the effects of low energy availability  (EA)[15 kcal·kg lean body mass (LBM)-1·d-1] achieved by diet or exercise on bone  turnover markers in active, eumenorrheic women. METHODS: By using a crossover design, ten eumenorrheic women (VO2 peak:  48.1 ± 3.3 ml·kg-1·min-1) completed all three, 3-day conditions in a randomised  order: controlled EA (CON; 45 kcal·kgLBM-1·d-1), low EA through dietary energy  restriction (D-RES; 15 kcal·kgLBM-1·d-1) and low EA through increasing exercise  energy expenditure (E-RES; 15 kcal·kgLBM-1·d-1), during the follicular phase of  three menstrual cycles. In CON, D-RES and E-RES, participants consumed diets  providing 45, 15 and 45 kcal·kgLBM-1·d-1. In E-RES only, participants completed  supervised running sessions (129 ± 10 min·d-1) at 70% of their VO2 peak that  resulted in an exercise energy expenditure of 30 kcal·kg LBM-1·d-1. Blood  samples were collected at baseline (BASE) and at the end of the 3-day period  (D6) and analysed for bone turnover markers (β-CTX and P1NP), markers of calcium  metabolism (PTH, albumin-adjusted Ca, Mg and PO4) and hormones (IGF-1, T3,  insulin, leptin and 17β-oestradiol). RESULTS: In D-RES, P1NP concentrations at D6 decreased by 17% (BASE:  54.8 ± 12.7 μg·L-1, D6: 45.2 ± 9.3 μg·L-1, P < 0.001, d = 0.91) and were lower  than D6 concentrations in CON (D6: 52.5 ± 11.9 μg·L-1, P = 0.001). P1NP did not  change significantly in E-RES (BASE: 55.3 ± 14.4 μg·L-1, D6: 50.9 ± 15.8 μg·L-1,  P = 0.14). β-CTX concentrations did not change following D-RES (BASE:  0.48 ± 0.18 μg·L-1, D6: 0.55 ± 0.17 μg·L-1) or E-RES (BASE: 0.47 ± 0.24 μg·L-1,  D6: 0.49 ± 0.18 μg·L-1) (condition × time interaction effect, P = 0.17). There  were no significant differences in P1NP (P = 0.25) or β-CTX (P = 0.13) responses  between D-RES and E-RES. Both conditions resulted in reductions in IGF-1 (-13%  and - 23% from BASE in D-RES and E-RES, both P < 0.01) and leptin (-59%  and - 61% from BASE in D-RES and E-RES, both P < 0.001); T3 decreased in D-RES  only (-15% from BASE, P = 0.002) and PO4 concentrations decreased in E-RES only  (-9%, P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Low EA achieved through dietary energy restriction resulted in a  significant decrease in bone formation but no change in bone resorption, whereas  low EA achieved through exercise energy expenditure did not significantly  influence bone metabolism. Both low EA conditions elicited significant and  similar changes in hormone concentrations.  Crown Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Electronic address: y1kawano@nodai.ac.jp.  BACKGROUND: Previous studies have found more frequent increases in dietary  intake and nonrestorative nocturnal sleep during the luteal phase than in the  follicular phase, but few studies have investigated how increased energy intake  at dinner influences sleep by considering the correlation between female hormone  and cardiac autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity. This study examined the  effects of energy intake at dinner on ANS activity during nighttime sleep in  order to evaluate restorative sleep in healthy women. We also examined whether  ANS activity is associated with female hormone dynamics. METHODS: Twenty-four healthy collegiate women participated in this randomized  crossover trial. Each was assigned to receive a High Energy Dinner (HED) or Low  Energy Dinner (LED) treatment. Energy ratios of each test meal (breakfast,  lunch, and dinner) to total energy intake were 1:1:2 and 1:2:1 for HED and LED  treatments, respectively. Each participant wore an ECG recorder before dinner  and removed it upon waking the next morning. Power spectral analysis of heart  rate variability was used to calculate low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF),  and total spectral power (TP). Cardiac sympathetic (SNS) and parasympathetic  (PNS) nervous system activity were evaluated as LF/HF and HF/TP, respectively. RESULTS: Mean HF/TP for the entire sleeping period was lower with HED treatment  compared to LED treatment (41.7 ± 11.4 vs. 45.0 ± 12.13, P = .034). Intergroup  comparisons of the initial 3-h sleeping period revealed that LF/HF (0.87 ± 0.82  vs. 0.66 ± 0.82, P = .013) and HF/TP (45.6 ± 13.9 vs. 51.5 ± 11.8, P = .002)  were higher and lower, respectively, with HED treatment compared to LED  treatment. Progesterone levels were positively correlated with LF/HF with LED  treatment, and negatively correlated with HF/TP with both HED and LED  treatments. CONCLUSION: Higher energy intake at dinner increases and decreases SNS and PNS  activities, respectively, resulting in nonrestorative nocturnal sleep. In  addition, a negative correlation was observed between progesterone and PNS  activity, highlighting the difficulty of increasing PNS activity during sleep in  the luteal phase compared to the follicular phase.

29125183,Ovarian surgery for symptom relief in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.,"Lepine S, Jo J, Metwally M, Cheong YC","1. Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2017 Nov 10;11(11):CD009526. doi:  10.1002/14651858.CD009526.pub2.  Ovarian surgery for symptom relief in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.  Lepine S(1), Jo J, Metwally M, Cheong YC.  Author information: (1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Capital and Coast District Health  Board, Wellington, New Zealand.  Update of     doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD009526.  BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine condition,  affecting approximately one in 10 women. PCOS is defined by two of three  features: oligo- or anovulation, clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism or  both, or polycystic ovaries.Women with PCOS can have a wide range of health  problems, including infrequent and irregular periods, unwanted hair growth and  acne, and subnormal fertility. Long-term health concerns include an increased  risk of heart disease, diabetes and the development of precancerous disease of  the womb. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and harms of ovarian surgery as a  treatment for symptomatic relief of hirsutism, acne and menstrual irregularity  in PCOS. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group  specialized register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO (from inception to  17 October 2016). We handsearched citation lists, registers of ongoing trials  and conference proceedings. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of women  undergoing ovarian drilling in comparison to no treatment, medical treatment, or  other forms of surgical treatment for the symptoms of PCOS. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures  recommended by Cochrane. The primary outcome measures were improvement in  menstrual regularity and androgenic symptoms of PCOS (hirsutism, acne); the  secondary outcome measures included harms, change of body mass index (BMI),  waist circumference, androgen levels, metabolic measures and quality of life. We  assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE methods. MAIN RESULTS: We included 22 RCTs (2278 women analyzed) of participants with  PCOS and symptoms of acne, hirsutism or irregular menstrual cycles, all of which  included laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) as an intervention.Two studies  reported their funding source (Farquhar 2002 - supported in part by the Auckland  Medical Research Foundation; Sarouri 2015 - the authors thank the Vice  Chancellor for Research of Guilan University of Medical Sciences for funding  this project).The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate  quality. The main limitations were imprecision associated with the low number of  studies, inconsistency and risk of bias associated with the inability to blind  participants. There were too few studies to assess risk of publication bias.  Menstrual RegularityTwo studies compared LOD versus metformin (n=226) but no  conclusions could be drawn with regard to menstrual regularity, as their  findings were inconsistent and they were unsuitable for pooling. There appeared  to be little or no difference in the rate of women reporting improvement in  menstrual regularity when LOD was compared with medical treatment including  metformin + clomiphene (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.64, 2 studies, 332 women, I2 =  13%, low-quality evidence), letrozole (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.84, 1 study,  260 women, low-quality evidence), or metformin + letrozole (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.49  to 1.81, 1 study, 146 women, low-quality evidence). However, one study reported  that LOD was superior to gonadotrophin (OR 19.2, 95% CI 3.17 to 116.45, 1 study,  35 women, very low-quality evidence).There appeared to be little or no  difference in the rate of women reporting improvement in menstrual regularity  when bilateral unipolar LOD was compared to unilateral LOD (OR 1.51, 95% CI 0.62  to 3.71, 2 studies, 104 women, I2 = 0%, moderate-quality evidence), transvaginal  ultrasound-guided LOD (OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.37, 1 study, 147 women,  low-quality evidence), LOD using adjusted thermal dose in accordance with the  ovarian volume (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.14, 1 study, 115 women, low-quality  evidence) or bipolar LOD (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.05 to 18.57, 1 study, 18 women,  low-quality evidence).Four to five punctures per ovary may improve the rate of  women reporting menstrual regularity compared with two or fewer (OR 16.04, 95%  CI 4.19 to 61.34, 2 studies, 73 women, I2 = 0%, low-quality evidence).  Androgenic SymptomsThere was probably little or no difference in improvement in  androgenic symptoms when LOD was compared to metformin (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.42 to  2.37, 1 study, 126 women, moderate-quality evidence) or gonadotrophins; acne (OR  3.20, 95% CI 0.33 to 30.94, 1 study, 25 women, low-quality evidence), hirsutism  (OR 2.31, 95% CI 0.22 to 23.89, 1 study, 25 women, low-quality evidence).There  appeared to be little or no difference in improvement of androgenic symptoms  when LOD was compared to transvaginal ultrasound-guided LOD, with respect to  hirsutism (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.30 to 3.91, 1 study, 39 women, low-quality  evidence) or acne (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.20 to 3.50, 1 study, 31 women, low-quality  evidence). HarmsLOD was associated with fewer gastrointestinal side effects than  metformin plus clomiphene (OR 0.05, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.36, 2 studies, 332 women,  I2 = 0%, moderate-quality evidence). One study suggested little or no difference  in rates of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome between LOD and gonadotrophins (OR  0.08, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.61, 1 study, 33 women, low-quality evidence).There were  fewer adhesions with transvaginal hydrolaparoscopy compared to LOD (OR 0.10, 95%  CI 0.05 to 0.18, 1 study, 246 women, moderate-quality evidence). There appeared  to be little or no difference in adhesions when variable energy LOD was compared  with standard LOD (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.32 to 2.88, 1 study, 64 women, low-quality  evidence). Another study (44 women) reported that none of the women who returned  for surgery following either traditional or unilateral LOD were found to have  adhesions. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There was no clear evidence that LOD improves menstrual  regularity or the androgenic symptoms of PCOS, compared to most of the medical  treatments used in the included studies. LOD was associated with fewer  gastrointestinal side effects compared to metformin and clomiphene.There was  also no clear evidence of different effectiveness between types of LOD, except  that LOD with four to five punctures per ovary may be more effective than two or  fewer punctures. There was little evidence comparing LOD with different types of  surgery, although one study concluded that transvaginal hydrolaparoscopy had a  lower risk of adhesions than LOD.There was evidence from one small study of  benefit from LOD compared to gonadotrophins for menstrual regulation. However,  gonadotrophins are seldom used for this indication.

24959783,Assessment of intake of iron and nutrients that affect bioavailability of daily food rations of girls.,"Broniecka A, Wyka J, Bronkowska M, Piotrowska E, Biernat J","1. Ann Agric Environ Med. 2014;21(2):327-30. doi: 10.5604/1232-1966.1108598.  Assessment of intake of iron and nutrients that affect bioavailability of daily  food rations of girls.  Broniecka A(1), Wyka J(1), Bronkowska M(1), Piotrowska E(1), Biernat J(1).  Author information: (1)Department of Human Nutrition, University of the Environmental and Life  Sciences, Wrocław, Poland.  INTRODUCTION AND AIM: In a human body iron occurs at a level of 3 to 5 g, 60-70  % of which are in hemoglobin, ca. 10% in myoglobin, and ca. 3% are accumulated  in enzymes of cellular respiration or enzymes degrading toxic hydrogen peroxide.  The other part of iron is accumulated in liver, spleen, kidneys and bone marrow.  The dietary deficiency of iron appears at its insufficient level in a diet and  at impaired absorption of iron ions present in food products by a body. Groups  at an especially high risk of iron deficiencies include, among others,  menstruating girls in the pubescence period and women with heavy and irregular  menstruations, as well as vegetarians and patients with chronic enteritis. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the intake of iron and nutrients that affect its  bioavailability from daily food rations of girls. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 159 girls aged 17-18, students of high  schools in the city of Wroclaw. The study was conducted between November 2010  and ay 2011. Girls were divided into 3 subgroups according to the BMI score.  Girls' diets were analyzed with the method of a direct interview of the last 24  hours before the test and the interview was repeated seven times. RESULTS The  present study demonstrated that the intake of iron from food rations of almost  all the girls surveyed was below the requirements defined for this age group.  Statistically significant differences were noted in the intake of energy and  nutrients among the three distinguished subgroups of girls. CONCLUSIONS Food  rations of the surveyed girls were characterized by a low, compared to dietary  allowances, calorific value, which resulted in deficiencies of nutrients  increasing iron bioavailability.

CONTEXT: Puberty is a crucial period of dramatic hormonal changes, accelerated  growth, attainment of reproductive capacity, and acquisition of peak bone mass.  Participation in recreational physical activity is widely acknowledged to  provide significant health benefits in this period. Conversely, intense training  imposes several constraints, such as training stress and maintenance of very low  body fat to maximize performance. Adolescent female athletes are therefore at  risk of overtraining and/or poor dietary intake, which may have several  consequences for endocrine function. The ""adaptive"" changes in the  hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal, -adrenal, and somatotropic axes and the  secretory role of the adipose tissue are reviewed, as are their effects on  growth, menstrual cycles, and bone mass acquisition. DESIGN: A systematic search on Medline between 1990 and 2013 was conducted using  the following terms: ""intense training,"" ""physical activity,"" or ""exercise""  combined with ""hormone,"" ""endocrine,"" and ""girls,"" ""women,"" or ""elite female  athletes."" All articles reporting on the endocrine changes related to intense  training and their potential implications for growth, menstrual cycles, and bone  mass acquisition were considered. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Young female athletes present a high prevalence of  menstrual disorders, including delayed menarche, oligomenorrhea, and amenorrhea,  characterized by a high degree of variability according to the type of sport.  Exercise-related reproductive dysfunction may have consequences for growth  velocity and peak bone mass acquisition. Recent findings highlight the endocrine  role of adipose tissue and energy balance in the regulation of homeostasis and  reproductive function. A better understanding of the mechanisms whereby intense  training affects the endocrine system may orient research to develop innovative  strategies (ie, based on nutritional or pharmacological approaches and  individualized modalities of training and competition) to improve the medical  care of these adolescents and protect their reproductive function.

Author information: (1)Department of Woman and Child Health, Division of Obstetrics and Gynecology,  Karolinska Institutet, SE-171 76 Stockholm, Sweden.  angelica.linden-hirschberg@karolinska.se  BACKGROUND: Menstrual disturbances in female athletes are often explained as a  consequence of energy deficiency. Oral contraceptive (OC) treatment may have  favorable metabolic effects. We evaluated effects of OCs on diurnal secretions  of insulin, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1), growth  hormone (GH) and cortisol in relation to changes in body composition in athletes  with menstrual disturbance compared with regularly menstruating athletes and  controls. METHODS: Age- and BMI-matched groups of endurance athletes with menstrual  disturbance (OAM, n = 9) and regularly cycling athletes (RM, n = 8) and  sedentary controls (CTRL, n = 8) were examined, and hormone levels measured,  before and after 8 months of treatment with a low-dose combined OC (30 microg  ethinyl estradiol + 150 microg levonorgestrel). RESULTS: Before OC treatment, the diurnal profile of insulin was lower (P <  0.01) and levels of IGFBP-1 (P < 0.05) and cortisol (P < 0.05) were higher in  OAM athletes than in CTRL, whereas GH secretion was higher than in RM athletes  (P < 0.05). After treatment, diurnal secretions of these hormones were similar  between groups with an increase of IGFBP-1 in the regularly menstruating  subjects only (P < 0.001). OC treatment increased body fat mass in OAM athletes  (P < 0.01 versus baseline). The change in total fat mass correlated positively  with pretreatment diurnal levels of GH (r(s) = 0.67, P < 0.01) and cortisol  (r(s) = 0.64, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: OC treatment in endurance athletes with menstrual disturbance  increases body fat mass and results in diurnal levels of insulin, IGFBP-1, GH  and cortisol that are comparable to those in regularly menstruating subjects.  These results suggest that OCs improve metabolic balance in OAM athletes.  DOI: 10.1093/humrep/dep350 PMCID: PMC2794666 PMID: 19840988 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Orsola-Malpighi Hospital, Via Massarenti 9, 40138 Bologna, Italy.  CONTEXT: The few controlled trials performed so far indicate that the addition  of metformin and/or flutamide to a hypocaloric diet in obese women with  polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) effectively influences different phenotypic  aspects of the syndrome. All these studies are, however, characterized by a  short to medium period of treatment. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to investigate the long-term effects of these  therapies. DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled  trial at a medical center. PATIENTS: Of 80 overweight-obese women with PCOS, 76 completed the study. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were placed on a hypocaloric diet for the first month  and then on a hypocaloric diet plus placebo, metformin (850 mg, orally, twice a  day), flutamide (250 mg, orally, twice a day), or metformin plus flutamide for  the subsequent 12 months (20 subjects in each group). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We assessed clinical features, computerized tomography  measurement of fat distribution, androgens, lipids, and fasting and  glucose-stimulated glucose and insulin levels at baseline and after 6 and 12  months of treatment. RESULTS: After 6 months, compared with placebo, flutamide further decreased  visceral/sc fat mass (P = 0.044), androstenedione (P < 0.001),  dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (P < 0.001), and hirsutism score (P < 0.001),  whereas metformin further increased frequency of menstruation (P = 0.039). After  12 months, flutamide maintained the effects observed after 6 months on  visceral/sc fat mass (P = 0.033) and androstenedione (P < 0.001), whereas it  produced an additional decrease in dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (P = 0.020)  and hirsutism score (P = 0.019); metformin further improved the menstrual  pattern (P = 0.013). Moreover, after 12 months, flutamide improved more than  placebo the menstrual pattern (P = 0.008), glucose-stimulated glucose levels (P  = 0.041), insulin sensitivity (P < 0.001), and low-density lipoprotein  cholesterol levels (P = 0.003), whereas metformin decreased glucose-stimulated  insulin levels (P = 0.014). The combination of the two drugs maintained the  specific effect of each of the compounds, without any additive or synergistic  effect. CONCLUSIONS: These findings add relevance to the usefulness of metformin and  flutamide in the treatment of dieting overweight-obese PCOS women and provide a  rationale for targeting different therapeutic options according to the required  outcomes in the long term.

Abraham SF(1), Pettigrew B, Boyd C, Russell J, Taylor A.  Author information: (1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Sydney, Royal North  Shore Hospital, NSW, Australia. sabraham@med.usyd.edu.au  We investigated the usefulness of amenorrhoea as a criterion in eating disorder  diagnoses. Menstrual history, eating disordered behavior and weight history of  251 female eating disorder inpatients were assessed on admission to hospital.  Menstrual status of 88 (35%) could not be assessed (80 taking hormonal  contraception, 5 (< 16 years) had never menstruated, one hysterectomized, 2  postmenopausal). Of the remaining 163; 90 had secondary amenorrhoea (no periods  for > 3 months), 19 irregular periods and 54 regular cycles. Some patients with  recent changes in energy status, who warranted inpatient treatment for their  eating disorder did not develop amenorrhoea until later during their admission.  Menstrual disturbance is not limited to anorexia nervosa, 24% of patients with  an eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS) and 15% of bulimic patients  had amenorrhoea/oligomenorrhoea on admission. The best predictors (82% cases,  83% noncases, R2 = 0.41) of secondary amenorrhoea at admission, were; current  BMI < or = 18, and having rules for exercising. Menstrual status of women with  an eating disorder diagnosis cannot always be assessed, is mostly measuring low  body weight and exercise and is not useful in planning or initiating treatment.  There is insufficient evidence to support the use of amenorrhoea as a criterion  for any eating disorder.  DOI: 10.1080/01674820500064997 PMID: 16295519 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Author information: (1)Department of Physiology, Medical School of the University of the  Witwatersrand, 7 York Road, Parktown Johannesburg, South Africa.  rochelle@harold.sci.ccny.cuny.edu  Changes in mood, performance, cortisol, and physiological variables with a  month-long energy restricting diet (3.347 MJ/day) were studied in nine  overweight (mean mass 71.2 +/- 8 kg; body mass index 26.1 +/- 2.8 kg/m(2)),  healthy premenopausal (age 20-36 years) women. Measurements were taken in the 2  weeks before the diet (baseline) and again in the final 2 weeks of the diet to  attenuate menstrual cycle differences. A reduction in energy intake and  concomitant weight loss (5.80 +/- 1.65 kg) were accompanied by a significant  decline in systolic blood pressure (5.4%), heart rate (7.6%), and cortisol  concentration (13.6%). Fatigue and vigour on the Profile of Mood States (POMS)  questionnaire were adversely affected; however, subjective assessments of mood,  concentration, temperature sensitivity, appetite, and sleep quality using visual  analogue scales, were not significantly altered during the month-long period of  energy restriction. Motor performance, as assessed by hand-eye coordination,  improved with both a reduction in mean reaction time and improved accuracy in  response to visual stimuli. The very low-energy diet appeared to be neither  physiologically nor psychologically stressful. Beneficial effects were evident  with a reduction in BMI, reduced risk of cardiovascular stress, improved motor  performance, and a decline in physiological stress with dieting success.

10095971,Bone density among long-term users of medroxyprogesterone acetate as a contraceptive.,"Paiva LC, Pinto-Neto AM, Faundes A","1. Contraception. 1998 Dec;58(6):351-5. doi: 10.1016/s0010-7824(98)00125-5.  Bone density among long-term users of medroxyprogesterone acetate as a  contraceptive.  Paiva LC(1), Pinto-Neto AM, Faundes A.  Author information: (1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, School of Medical Sciences,  Universidade Estadual de Campinas (UNICAMP), São Paulo, Brazil.  The bone density (BD) of 72 women using depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA)  for at least 1 year was compared with that of 64 women who were not users of  hormonal contraceptives. The BD of lumbar spine, femoral neck, Ward's triangle,  and trochanter was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA-LUNAR  DPX). Estradiol (E2) concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA). The  mean age of DMPA users and nonusers was 31.8 and 31.1 years, respectively. Mean  E, was 55.7 pg/mL for users and 149.9 pg/mL for controls (p < 0.001). The BD was  significantly lower for DMPA users than for controls in all sites (p < 0.01). In  addition, young adult T-scores in the lumbar spine were significantly lower  among DMPA users than in controls (p < 0.01). Differences were maintained in a  subsample of 47 women per group paired by age and body mass index (BMI).  Multiple regression analysis showed that older age, lower BMI, and longer  amenorrhea were associated with lower BD in the femoral neck, whereas lower BMI  and use of DMPA were associated with lower BD in the lumbar spine.  PIP: Family planning programs that offer depot medroxyprogesterone acetate  (DMPA) cannot be indifferent to the risk of lowered bone density. A study  conducted at the Family Planning Clinic of the State University of Campinas (Sao  Paulo, Brazil) compared bone densities in 72 women who had been using DMPA for  at least 1 year (mean duration, 42 months) and 64 regularly menstruating  nonusers. Mean age was 31 years in both groups; there were no significant  differences between the 2 groups in terms of ethnicity, body mass index (BMI),  or smoking. Mean serum estradiol concentrations were 55.7 +or- 40.5 pg/ml for  DMPA users and 149.9 +or- 88.2 pg/ml for nonusers (p 0.001). The mean length of  amenorrhea was 26.5 +or- 23.8 months among DMPA users. The mean bone density in  DMPA users was significantly lower than that of controls at all sites evaluated  (i.e., lumbar spine, femoral neck, Ward's triangle, and trochanter). 38 DMPA  users, compared with only 17 controls, had a T-score in the lumbar spine lower  than -1 standard deviation (p = 0.014). Multiple regression analysis identified  BMI and DMPA use as variables significantly associated with bone density in the  lumbar spine; in the femoral neck, these variables were BMI, age, and length of  amenorrhea. Periodic bone densitometry should be considered for women over 40  years of age with low BMI who have more than 2 years of continuous amenorrhea.

Fukuoka Igaku Zasshi. 1994 Sep;85(9):263-6.  [Hormonal abnormalities were improved by weight loss using very low calorie diet  in a patient with polycystic ovary syndrome].  [Article in Japanese]  Okajima T(1), Koyanagi T, Goto M, Kato K.  Author information: (1)Department of Internal Medicine, Kokura National Hospital, Kitakyushu-shi.  A 27-year old woman was admitted to our hospital because of oligomenorrhea,  hirsutism and obesity. Her menstrual period has been irregular since she was 14  years old. Her weight increased rapidly after the age of 15 and she became  obese. Hirsutism was noticed at the age of 16. The diagnosis of polycystic ovary  syndrome was made on her illness through the endocrinological examinations: (1)  The response of LH to LH-RH administration was much higher than that of FSH. (2)  The concentration of plasma testosterone was increased. (3) Plasma level of E2  was decreased while that of E1 was increased. (4) CT scan showed bilateral  ovarian cyctic masses. In addition, hyperinsulinemia was observed during the 75g  glucose tolerance test and the presence of insulin resistance was suggested. As  she was overweight (BMI; 33.6 kg/m2), weight loss was expected to improve her  hormonal abnormalities. She went on a very low calorie diet of 420 kcal/day  (Optifast, Sandoz, USA). When she lost around 9kg of weight, her menstruation  period started that has not been observed for the previous 5 months. Plasma  levels of LH, FSH and testosterone were lowered following the weight loss. The  responses of LH to LH-RH and IRI to glucose were decreased as well. She left the  hospital after the second menstruation occurred at the proper period. From these  results, the importance of weight loss was suggested in overweight patients with  polycystic ovary syndrome. The benefit of very low calorie diet was also noticed  since it brought a rapid weight loss as well as rapid improvements of hormonal  abnormalities.  PMID: 7959530 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"
8289605,Low bone mineral density at axial and appendicular sites in amenorrheic athletes.,"Myburgh KH, Bachrach LK, Lewis B, Kent K, Marcus R","1. Med Sci Sports Exerc. 1993 Nov;25(11):1197-202.  Low bone mineral density at axial and appendicular sites in amenorrheic  athletes.  Myburgh KH(1), Bachrach LK, Lewis B, Kent K, Marcus R.  Author information: (1)Musculoskeletal Research Laboratory, Department of Veterans Affairs Medical  Center, Palo Alto, CA 94304.  Amenorrheic athletes have low axial bone-mineral density (BMD, g.cm-2). We  compared 12 amenorrheic and 9 eumenorrheic women athletes to determine whether  athletes with amenorrhea have lower BMD in other skeletal regions, including  weight-bearing lower limbs. BMD was measured by dual energy x-ray and single  photon absorptiometry. Both groups had similar age, body mass, and exercise  quantity. Women with amenorrhea missed 86.3 +/- 58.3 menstrual periods since  menarche. BMD was lower in the amenorrheic vs eumenorrheic subjects for the  lumbar spine (0.928 +/- 0.056 vs 1.050 +/- 0.110, P < 0.005), whole body (1.032  +/- 0.05 vs 1.09 +/- 0.06, P < 0.05), most regions of the whole body (P <  0.05-0.001), all areas of the proximal femur (P < 0.005), and at the femoral  mid-shaft (1.333 +/- 0.109 vs 1.491 +/- 0.088, P < 0.005). No significant  differences were detected at the mid-radius and tibial shaft. The best  predictors of BMD were years of regular menstruation for lumbar spine; and years  of amenorrhea for hip, femoral mid-shaft, and whole body. We conclude that low  BMD in athletes with amenorrhea is not limited to the axial skeleton but is also  present in other regions including appendicular weight-bearing bones.

1634568,The ecology of birth seasonality among agriculturalists in central Africa.,"Bailey RC, Jenike MR, Ellison PT, Bentley GR, Harrigan AM, Peacock NR","1. J Biosoc Sci. 1992 Jul;24(3):393-412. doi: 10.1017/s0021932000019957.  The ecology of birth seasonality among agriculturalists in central Africa.  Bailey RC(1), Jenike MR, Ellison PT, Bentley GR, Harrigan AM, Peacock NR.  Author information: (1)University of California, Los Angeles.  The Lese are subsistence farmers living in the Ituri Forest of north-east Zaïre.  They exhibit significant birth seasonality, with lowest frequencies of  conception when food production is least, nutritional status is low and ovarian  function, as measured by salivary steroid hormone levels, is reduced. Efe pygmy  foragers, who live in the same geographical area but are less dependent on  cultivated foods and have a more flexible life style, do not exhibit frequent  fluctuations in nutritional status nor significant birth seasonality. These  findings support a model of birth seasonality relating climatic variables to  variation in fertility through a causal chain linking rainfall to food  production to energy balance to ovarian function to fertility. The model, which  emphasises an ecological approach to the study of human reproduction, should  have broad applicability since seasonality of food production and energy balance  is widespread geographically and across a wide variety of economies and  cultures.  PIP: Researchers compared 1980-87 data on rainfall, garden size, nutritional  status, ovarian function, and births among the Lese subsistence farmers and the  nomadic Efe pygmies who lived in the Ituri Forest in northeast Zaire to analyze  the ecology of human birth seasonality. Natural fertility for the Lese was 2.35  and 2.56 for the Efe. Rainfall patterns determined the size of Lese gardens  (p.05) which in turn determined nutritional status for both the Lese and the Efe  (p.01), but particularly the Lese. Negative changes in female nutritional status  diminished ovarian function. Specifically, women with lower indices of weight  for height and who had lost 2 kg during the study had lower peak progesterone  levels and ovulatory frequency than women who lost =or 2 kg. Menstrual cycles  lengthened and duration of menstrual flow decreased with a decline in  nutritional status. Conceptions were significantly reduced in May-July for the  Lese (p=.012). For both Efe and Lese women, conceptions were lowest in May and  highest in September. Lese women experienced considerably fewer conceptions  during the periods with poor food availability than during other months  (p=.002). The corresponding p value was almost significant for Efe women (.55).  Thus Efe women experience less fluctuations in nutritional status than did Lese  women, but variability in the seasonal pattern of rainfall did determine  variation in fertility. The causal chain was rainfall - determined food  production which determined energy balance which determined ovarian function  which determined fertility. This model can be applied to any population in any  geographic region. It integrates knowledge of behavior and cultural practices  with the biology of human reproduction.

Aetiological approach of female reproductive physiology in lactational  amenorrhoea.  Rosetta L(1).  Author information: (1)Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, France.  PIP: The duration of postpartum amenorrhea and return of ovulation varies on an  individual and population basis. In 1980, in Senegal, the relationship of  chronic malnutrition and female fertility was investigated for 2 years. The  stability of the female body regarding weight and arm circumference despite a  heavy annual workload was a surprising finding. The mean female body mass index  was higher for lactating women in amenorrhea than required for restoring  menstruation in European women. The mean duration of postpartum amenorrhea was  18.2 +or- .6 months. The difference between those who resumed menstruation (20.9  +or- .9 months) and who still had amenorrhea (25.4 +or- 2.2 months) was  significant. The duration of breast feeding determined the duration of  amenorrhea. Studies have found a link between ovarian dysfunction and women in  harsh third world environments and sportswomen under intensive training with  both showing irregular menstruation and amenorrhea. Long duration of cycles in  New Guinean women, high amount of anovulation in Zairian forest women, and  suppression of testosterone and estradiol levels in hunter-gatherers were found.  In affluent Europeans and urbanized women in developing countries postpartum  amenorrhea dropped drastically. Long distance runners are often vegetarians with  low calorie consumption and with a high degree of menstrual trouble owing to low  body fat and weight-for-height. The role of beta-endorphins in the hypothalamic  blockade of the gonadotropin releasing hormone pulse generator and high stress  or physical training is proven. The functioning of the  hypothalamo-pituitary-ovarian axis can be hurt by intensive training. Short-term  fasting also suppressed the pulsatile luteinizing hormone and testosterone  secretion. The protocol and methodology of an etiological study is outlined  regarding the factors of this hypothesis on amenorrhea.  DOI: 10.1017/s0021932000019866 PMID: 1634559 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"
3766729,Effects of energy deprivation on sex hormone patterns in healthy menstruating women.,"Kurzer MS, Calloway DH","1. Am J Physiol. 1986 Oct;251(4 Pt 1):E483-8. doi: 10.1152/ajpendo.1986.251.4.E483.  Effects of energy deprivation on sex hormone patterns in healthy menstruating  women.  Kurzer MS, Calloway DH.  To determine whether short-term energy deprivation affects sex hormone patterns,  six healthy women were studied for two menstrual cycles. Two diets containing  recommended levels of all nutrients and differing substantially only with  respect to energy content were provided in sequence. During the first cycle,  energy intake was 40 +/- 2 kcal/kg body weight, and weight was essentially  constant. For the second cycle, energy intake was reduced to 41% of the original  intake, averaging 17 +/- 1 kcal/kg initial body weight. During the low-energy  diet, weight loss ranged from 3.2 to 6.7 kg. The two leanest women, who also  lost the most weight, became anovulatory and amenorrheic in the low-energy  period. Within a specific phase of cycle, however, the diet did not affect  concentrations of estradiol, progesterone, luteinizing hormone, or  follicle-stimulating hormone. Testosterone and androstenedione levels peaked  midcycle normally and were decreased with the low-energy diet, while levels of  sex hormone-binding globulin increased and those of dehydroepiandrosterone  sulfate did not change. These results demonstrate short-term dietary and body  composition effects on the menstrual cycle and serum androgens.  DOI: 10.1152/ajpendo.1986.251.4.E483 PMID: 3766729 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Kaneko K, Nishida K, Yatsuda J, Koike G.  The effect of L-methionine supplementation on the utilization of a soy protein  isolate (SPI) was evaluated by short-term nitrogen balance studies in young  women. Thirteen female students were given SPI in an initial period and SPI  supplemented with 1% methionine in a second period immediately after  menstruation as the sole source of protein. After one day on protein-free diet,  each subject received conventional low-protein diet for three days, and then low  protein, semisynthetic diet containing 0.5 g/kg/day (seven subjects) or 0.3  g/kg/day (six subjects) of SPI or SPI supplemented with methionine for seven  days. The energy intake was approximately of a maintenance level of 36.5 +/- 3.8  kcal/kg/day. The mean N balances of the subjects at an intake level of 0.5  g/kg/day in the SPI period and methionine supplemented period were -6.2 +/- 12.6  mg N/kg and -9.8 +/- 9.8 mg N/kg, respectively, while their N balances at an  intake level of 0.3 g/kg/day were -17.8 +/- 7.2 mg N/kg in the SPI period and  -15.5 +/- 3.0 mg N/kg in the methionine supplemented period. There was no  significant difference between the values in the SPI and methionine supplemented  periods at both levels of protein intake. Blood analyses were carried out before  and after the SPI period and after the period of methionine supplementation. The  urinary creatinine and urea excretions during these periods were not markedly  affected.  DOI: 10.3177/jnsv.32.123 PMID: 3712106 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"
