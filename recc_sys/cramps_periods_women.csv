PURPOSE: It is asserted that primary dysmenorrhea/menstrual cramps only occur in  ovulatory menstrual cycles. Our first objective was to present detailed  menstrual cramps information in normally ovulatory versus anovulatory cycles  from a single-cycle cohort study during the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic. Secondly, we  reviewed the literature for cohort studies documenting both menstrual cramps and  ovulation. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: The Menstruation and Ovulation Study 2 recruited 108  women ages 19-35 years to a prospective, observational single-cycle study,  recording cramps daily (0-4 scale) in the Menstrual Cycle Diary© and assessing  normal ovulation (luteal length ≥10 days) by the validated Quantitative Basal  Temperature© (Mean Temperature Method). We searched databases for « primary  dysmenorrhea » / » menstrual cramps »; « menstrual cycles »; « anovulation »,  finding four valid publications. RESULTS: In 75 women/cycles during the Pandemic, mean age was 28.5, body mass  index 23.5, and higher education (16 years); 40 normally ovulatory and 35  anovulatory cycles had similar lengths (29.5-30.0 days), respectively (P=0.571).  However, anovulatory cycles recorded significantly worse menstrual cramps versus  normally ovulatory cycles; anovulatory median intensity was 1.9 versus 1.6, and  Cramp Score was 8 versus 6 in normally ovulatory cycles (P=0.017). Four  publications in 273 women (991 cycles) showed cramps in both anovulatory and  ovulatory cycles; three were in adolescent/young adult women, one of which  documented a significantly greater percentage of cramps in ovulatory cycles. The  694 cycles in premenopausal women (20-41 years) showed similar percentages of  symptomatic cramps in cycles of both ovulatory types. Meta-analysis documented  significantly higher cramp prevalence in ovulatory cycles (OR 2.10; 95% CI 1.31,  3.37; P=0.002). CONCLUSION: This is the first documentation of more intense and frequent cramps  in anovulatory cycles. However, meta-analysis showing the presence of  symptomatic cramps in both ovulatory and anovulatory cycles documented they were  twice as prevalent in ovulatory menstrual cycles.  Plain Language Summary: “Worse Menstrual Cramps in Anovulatory Cycles”. Medicine  has long believed that menstrual cramps only occur in ovulatory menstrual cycles  that release an egg and have high progesterone levels that decrease before the  next period. The notion was that dropping progesterone levels triggered release  of prostaglandins that cause the pain and uterus muscle contractions of  menstrual cramps. This research studied 75 community women aged 19–35 years for  a single cycle during COVID-19. Forty women had normally ovulatory cycles and 35  had anovulatory cycles with a similar mean cycle length of 29.7 days. Women in  both groups were similar in age, weight, education and other reproductive  characteristics. Women recorded Menstrual Cycle Diary© daily experiences for  cramp presence and intensity (scored 0–4). Ovulation was documented by daily  first morning temperatures analyzed by the valid Quantitative Basal Temperature©  method. Results showed menstrual cramps occurred in both normally ovulatory and  anovulatory cycles. Surprisingly, anovulatory compared with ovulatory cycles had  cramps that lasted longer (4 rather than 3 days), were more intense (1.9 versus  1.6) and with significantly higher Cramp Scores (of 8 versus 6). We also found  four other published studies showing cramps occurred in both anovulatory and  ovulatory cycles. A meta-analysis of these, however, showed that cramps were  twice as frequent in ovulatory cycles. These results matter because they  stimulate the search for more accurate understandings of why menstrual cramps  occur. They will likely stimulate more effective therapies for the rare, intense  menstrual cramps that currently are not effectively treated by anti-inflammatory  medicines such as ibuprofen.  © 2024 Mann et al.

Witkoś J(1), Luberda E(1), Błażejewski G(1), Strój E(1).  Author information: (1)Faculty of Medicine and Health Science, Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski Krakow  University, Kraków, Poland.  Physique competitions are weight-sensitive sports in which stage presentation,  aesthetic appearance and posing ability of the athletes are judged rather than  physical performance. The aim of this study was to assess low energy  availability among female physique athletes by using the LEAF-Q. The study  involved 104 females who were physique athletes. Monthly cycle disorders were  reported in 58.65% of the women, that is periods stopped for three consecutive  months or longer (amenorrhea). This situation occurred before the research was  conducted in 43.27% of athletes and during the research in 15.38%. The physique  athletes claimed that menstruation changes occurred when there was an increased  exercise intensity, frequency or duration. Absence from training due to injury  was reported by 27.88% of the women. The LEAF-Q identified 46.15% of the  physique athletes as at risk (score ≥ 8) of low energy availability and the  physiological consequences related to RED-S. Women who had menstrual cycle  disorders were younger and did more training per week. Among women with  menstrual disorders, cramps or stomach ache which cannot be related to  menstruation occurred more frequently (p = 0.004). Absence from training or lack  of participation in competition due to injuries occurred more frequently in the  score ≥ 8 group (p = 0.024) thank the ≤ score 8 group. In the score ≥ 8 group  menstruation changes, that is less bleeding or cessation of menstruation (p =  0.035), occurred more frequently when there was an increase in exercise  intensity, frequency or duration (p = 0.002).

BACKGROUND: Primary dysmenorrhea, commonly known as menstrual cramps, is a  prevalent gynecological issue that impacts many women in their childbearing age.  It manifests as reoccurring, cramp-like lower abdominal pain, usually commencing  right prior to or during the menstrual period. These painful sensations can be  severe, extending to the lower back and upper thighs can greatly disrupt a  woman's daily life and overall well-being. The optimal exercise approach is  needed for individuals seeking relief from primary dysmenorrhea, allowing  healthcare providers and women themselves to make informed decisions regarding  their treatment options. Though many forms of exercise interventions exist in  the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea, this study aims to compare two forms of  intervention namely pilates and gym ball exercises on pain and menstrual  distress among women with Primary Dysmenorrhea. METHODS: This experimental comparative study was carried out with 30 young  female participants over a 12-week period. Participant recruitment was done  through a simple random sampling method. The criteria of inclusion encompassed  young females aged 17-25 years, those in good health, and those experiencing  primary dysmenorrhea. Exclusion criteria included secondary dysmenorrhea,  medication use, polycystic ovarian syndrome, bleeding disorders, positive  pregnancy tests, breastfeeding, and other medical conditions. Group A received  Pilates exercises, while Group B underwent Gym ball exercises. The assessment of  both groups' menstrual distress levels was conducted using the Moos Menstrual  Distress Questionnaire (MDQ) and pain scores using the Visual Analog Scale  (VAS). RESULT: In the statistical analysis, Group A (Pilates Exercises) showed a  significantly lower mean value (2.60) on the VAS compared to Group B (Swiss Ball  Exercises) (5.46), with both groups experiencing a notable reduction in  post-test scores (p ≤ 0.001). Additionally, on the MOOS MDQ score, Group A  (Pilates Exercises) achieved a lower mean value (79.33) compared to Group B  (Swiss Ball Exercises) (103.26), with both groups demonstrating a significant  decrease in post-test scores (p ≤ 0.001). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this study underscores the significance of exercise  therapy, particularly Pilates exercises, as a holistic approach to addressing  primary dysmenorrhea, improving physical well-being, and enhancing the overall  quality of life.

38773901,"""Just"" a painful period: A philosophical perspective review of the dismissal of menstrual pain.",Wiggleton-Little J,"1. Womens Health (Lond). 2024 Jan-Dec;20:17455057241255646. doi:  10.1177/17455057241255646.  ""Just"" a painful period: A philosophical perspective review of the dismissal of  menstrual pain.  Wiggleton-Little J(1).  Author information: (1)Center for Bioethics-JJS-60, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.  Science and society typically respond to dysmenorrhea-or painful menstrual  cramps-as a normal, natural, and inevitable part of menstruation. This  normalization has greatly contributed to the systemic dismissal of painful  menstrual cramps. Stigma, secrecy, and the expectation to ""cope"" fuel the  normalization of menstrual pain. In this article, I argue that the normalization  of menstrual pain restricts the ability to share an excruciating menstrual pain  in a way that would otherwise elicit alarm or concern. This can cause clinicians  to downgrade menstrual pain, and even menstruating persons to downgrade their  own pain. I refer to the dismissal of menstrual pain as an example of a  pain-related motivational deficit. A pain-related motivational deficit describes  instances in which an utterance fails to motivate due to societal practices and  ideas that make it difficult to recognize the import of the embodied experience  being shared.  Plain Language Summary: “Just” a painful period: why we are not concerned by  reported menstrual painIt is widely believed that painful menstrual cramps are  just a normal part of the menstrual cycle; something that all menstruating  persons are expected to deal with. There is also a stigma around periods and an  expectation to keep the experience of periods hidden. This creates a process  known as normalization. Because painful menstrual cramps are normalized, it is  easier to dismiss patients who report painful menstrual cramps. In this article,  I argue that the idea that painful menstrual cramps are normal makes it  difficult for others to be concerned or alarmed by reports of menstrual pain.  Reports of menstrual pain are downgraded or are seen as not that bad. When we  are unable to see how bad a pain is because society believes the reported pain  is normal, the pain report fails to elicit concern from the listener. I call  this process a pain-related motivational deficit.

Arch Immunol Ther Exp (Warsz). 2024 Mar 13;72(1). doi: 10.2478/aite-2024-0008.  eCollection 2024 Jan 1.  The Antigen-Processing Pathway via Major Histocompatibility Complex I as a New  Perspective in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Endometriosis.  Nowak I(1), Bochen P(1).  Author information: (1)Department of Clinical Immunology, Laboratory of Immunogenetics and Tissue,  Immunology, Ludwik Hirszfeld Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy,  Polish Academy of Sciences, Wrocław, Poland.  Endometriosis is a debilitating gynecological disease defined as the presence of  endometrium-like epithelium and/or stroma outside the uterine cavity. The most  commonly affected sites are the pelvic peritoneum, ovaries, uterosacral  ligaments, and the rectovaginal septum. The aberrant tissue responds to hormonal  stimulation, undergoing cyclical growth and shedding similar to appropriately  located endometrial tissue in the uterus. Common symptoms of endometriosis are  painful periods and ovulation, severe pelvic cramping, heavy bleeding, pain  during sex, urination and bowel pain, bleeding, and pain between periods.  Numerous theories have been proposed to explain the pathogenesis of  endometriosis. Sampson's theory of retrograde menstruation is considered to be  the most accepted. This theory assumes that endometriosis occurs due to the  retrograde flow of endometrial cells through the fallopian tubes during  menstruation. However, it has been shown that this process takes place in 90% of  women, while endometriosis is diagnosed in only 10% of them. This means that  there must be a mechanism that blocks the immune system from removing  endometrial cells and interferes with its function, leading to implantation of  the ectopic endometrium and the formation of lesions. In this review, we  consider the contribution of components of the Major Histocompatibility Complex  (MHC)-I-mediated antigen-processing pathway, such as the ERAP, TAP, LMP, LNPEP,  and tapasin, to the susceptibility, onset, and severity of endometriosis. These  elements can induce significant changes in MHC-I-bound peptidomes that may  influence the response of immune cells to ectopic endometrial cells.  © 2024 Izabela Nowak et al., published by Sciendo.

PURPOSE: To identify sources of information, perceptions, and potential  misinformation about menstruation among college-aged men in the United States. METHODS: This is a mixed-methods cross-sectional survey study of students in the  United States. Inclusion criteria included participants aged 17-29 years, male  gender identity, enrolled as an undergraduate or graduate student, and no  personal history of menstruation. RESULTS: This study included 70 participants. Almost half of all participants  (42.9%) first learned about menstruation from family members. More than  two-thirds of respondents felt that menstrual education was essential or very  important for all genders. The most common symptoms noted to be associated with  periods included cramping (93.6%), mood changes (80.9%), and vague ""hormonal""  changes (36.2%). When asked how a menstrual period might affect someone's  ability to perform daily activities, one-third reported debilitating or very  burdensome symptoms, whereas one-fifth felt periods do not have much impact. DISCUSSION: Comprehensive education and accurate reproductive health knowledge  are critical in combating gender bias and stigma. Most males surveyed agree that  education on menstruation is important, yet the majority do not have or do not  remember formal education on this topic, instead relying on family members and  friends as learning tools and resources. Most participants identified negative  symptoms associated with menstrual periods, especially mental health concerns  including mood changes and irritability. This association with mood changes, as  well as vague ""hormonal fluctuations,"" contributes to the societal bias against  people who menstruate by marking them as prone to emotional instability, thereby  exacerbating gender prejudices. It is therefore critical that accurate menstrual  education be widely available for everyone, regardless of gender.  Copyright © 2023 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

Quantifying the Impact of Dysmenorrhea Symptoms on Quality-of-Life and Access to  Oral Contraceptives by Income.  Choksey R, Mangal RK, Stead TS, Jones T, Flores R, Ganti L.  BACKGROUND: Dysmenorrhea, or painful menstrual periods, is one of the most  common gynecological complaints. Most reports of uterine contractions range  between moderate to severe pain, and patients often elect to cope with their  discomfort without assistance from a physician. In the process, women  experiencing dysmenorrhea are more likely to report absenteeism from work and  school. OBJECTIVES: This study measures the reported impact of dysmenorrhea on patients'  lives and elucidates a relationship between income and access to oral  contraceptives. METHODS: Two hundred women completed a survey about their symptoms, level of  pain, treatments, and the extent to which dysmenorrhea affected day-to-day  obligations. Most questions were multiple-choice while others permitted several  answer selections or were free response. The data was analyzed using JMP  statistical software. RESULTS: Eighty-four percent of respondents reported moderate to severe pain  during menstruation. This discomfort has caused 65.5% of the cohort to miss work  and 68% to avoid participating in social gatherings. Pain relief medications are  most often used as treatment - 143 respondents took ibuprofen, 93 took  acetaminophen, and 51 took naproxen. 29.5% of respondents are prescribed birth  control for cramps and blood flow. Income (p = 0.049), age (p = 0.002), and  education (p = 0.002) were significant predictors for oral contraceptive pill  (OCP) use. The lowest income groups were found to use OCPs at less than half the  rate as the highest income respondents. CONCLUSION: Dysmenorrhea affected most participants in the cohort with an impact  that extends beyond professional obligations. Income was found to be positively  correlated with increased OCP use, whereas education level was inversely  correlated. Clinicians should consider how patients' backgrounds influence their  access to OCP options. An improvement on this study's findings would be to  establish a causal relationship between these demographic factors and access to  OCPs.

Dysmenorrhea is painful menstrual periods which are caused by uterine  contractions. The ache is commonly felt in the pelvic or lower abdomen around  the time menstruation begins. Periods aren't the best time for a woman to feel  strong and energized. With all of the blood loss, cramps, and exhaustion,  finding enough excitement to get through the day's responsibilities is  difficult. Vulgaris Beta Potassium and nitrates, both of which are necessary for  blood pressure regulation, are abundant in juice. For energy, only 50ml of beet  juice is required. The analysis of data was done by descriptive and inferential  statistics. The study identified that 46.66 % had moderate pain, 33.33 % had  mild pain and none of them had severe pain for the pre- experimental group. The  study result shows that the pre-test mean value for is 5.91 and pre-test SD  0.96. The post-test mean value is 2.86 and post-test SD is 1.04. The mean  difference is 3.05.

Author information: (1)Department of Acupuncture and Tuina, Changchun University of Chinese  Medicine, Changchun, China.  BACKGROUND: Primary dysmenorrhea (PD) is a common problem among women. It is  defined as any degree of perceived cramping pain during menstruation without any  evident pathology. Auricular therapy (AT), a widely used alternative medical  treatment method as part of traditional Chinese acupuncture, lacks reliable  evidence to support its safety and effectiveness for PD. We aimed to conduct a  meta-analysis to investigate the efficacy and safety of AT in PD and to  investigate possible factors impacting the particular efficacy of AT in PD by  meta-regression. METHODS: This protocol followed the PRISMA guidelines of the Preferred Reporting  Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols. The following 9  sources will be searched for randomized control trials of AT for PD: the  Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, Medline, Embase, Web of  Science, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), China National Knowledge  Infrastructure, Chinese Science and Technology Periodicals (VIP) database and  WanFang Database from inception to January 1, 2023. Primary outcomes include  visual rating scales and clinical efficacy rates, while secondary outcomes  include endocrine hormone indicators related to PD and adverse events. Two  reviewers will work independently on study selection, data extraction, and  coding, including the risk of bias assessment in the included studies. While  conducting a meta-analysis, Review Manager version 5.3 will be employed.  Otherwise, a descriptive analysis will be performed. The results will be  displayed as a risk ratio with 95% confidence intervals for dichotomous data as  well as weight mean difference or standardized mean difference with 95%  confidence intervals for continuous data. RESULTS: This study's protocol will investigate the efficacy and safety of AT in  the treatment of PD in a systematic way. CONCLUSION: This systematic evaluation will objectively and systematically  assess the efficacy and safety of AT in PD based on the available evidence, as  well as provides clinicians with evidence to support the treatment of the  disease.

BACKGROUND: A number of previous studies have explored international students'  adaptation process with regards to language, lifestyle, food, and environment.  However, there have yet been no studies conducted to address the menstrual  symptoms challenges faced by international female students during the  acculturation period. Thus, this study aims to describe the prevalence of  menstrual symptoms change and to explore the influencing factors among  international female students studying in China during the acculturation period. METHODS: An online cross sectional study was conducted among international  female students studying in China during the acculturation period (defined as  the first six months of living in the host country) in Hunan Province of China  from March 2019 to July 2019. Menstrual symptoms questionnaire, sociocultural  adaptation scale, China higher education student satisfaction scale, perceived  stress scale, and Pittsburgh sleep quality index were used for data collection.  Descriptive analysis, ANOVA, paired t-test, Pearson correlation, and  multivariate linear regressions were used to analyze the data using SPSS 21.0  software. RESULTS: Three hundred and forty-five (97.18%, 345/355) female students from 45  countries fully completed the questionnaire. The mean age of the participants  was (26.59 ± 6.439) years. In total, 18.49% of participants had encountered  menstrual symptoms change. There were significant differences in the menstrual  symptoms score between before arrival and evaluation during the first six months  of living in China (t = - 11.700, p = 0.000). The main menstrual symptoms change  included cramps (17.68%), irritation (14.78%), abdominal pain (12.46%), fatigue  (12.46%), and headaches (9.85%). Cultural adaptation level (β = 0.198, 95% CI:  0.934, 2.995), sleep quality (β = 0.166, 95% CI: 0.112, 0.496), perceived stress  (β = 0.193, 95% CI: 0.123, 0.410), time spent in the host environment,  (β = - 0.270, 95% CI: - 3.200, - 1.444) and experience of visiting foreign  countries (β = 0.184, 95% CI: 1.134, 4.125) were significantly correlated with  menstrual symptoms change. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of menstrual symptoms change among international  female students should not be overlooked when considering menstrual health in  this population. Poorer cultural adaptation, poorer sleep quality, higher  stress, and lack of overseas living experiences significantly influence the  menstrual symptoms of international female students studying in China.  © 2022.

Nifedipine for primary dysmenorrhoea.  Earl RA(1), Grivell RM(2).  Author information: (1)Discipline of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, School of Paediatrics and  Reproductive Health, University of Adelaide, North Adelaide, Australia. (2)Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Flinders University and Flinders  Medical Centre, Bedford Park, Australia.  Update of     doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD012912.  BACKGROUND: Dysmenorrhoea (period pain) is a common condition with a substantial  impact on the well-being and productivity of women. Primary dysmenorrhoea is  defined as recurrent, cramping pelvic pain that occurs with periods, in the  presence of a normal uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes. It is thought to be  caused by uterine contractions (cramps) associated with a high level of  production of local chemicals such as prostaglandins. The muscle of the uterus  (the myometrium) responds to these high levels of prostaglandins by contracting  forcefully, causing low oxygen levels and consequently pain. Nifedipine is a  calcium channel blocker in widespread clinical use for preterm labour due to its  ability to inhibit uterine contractions in that setting. This review addresses  whether this effect of nifedipine also helps with relief of the uterine  contractions during menstruation OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and  safety of nifedipine for primary dysmenorrhoea. SEARCH METHODS: We searched for all published and unpublished randomised  controlled trials (RCTs) of nifedipine for dysmenorrhoea, without language  restriction and in consultation with the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility  Group (CGF) Information Specialist. The following databases were searched to 25  November 2021: the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group (CGF) Specialised  Register of Controlled Trials, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL.  Also searched were the international trial registers: ClinicalTrials.gov, and  the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry  Platform (ICTRP) search portal, the Web of Science, OpenGrey, LILACS database,  PubMed and Google Scholar. We checked the reference lists of relevant articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included RCTs comparing nifedipine with placebo for the  treatment of primary dysmenorrhoea. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The primary outcomes to be assessed were pain, and  health-related quality of life. Secondary outcomes were adverse effects,  satisfaction, and need for additional medication. The two review authors  independently assessed the included trials. There were insufficient data to  allow meaningful meta-analysis. MAIN RESULTS: The evidence assessed was of very low quality overall. We examined  three small RCTs, with a total of 106 participants. Data for analysis could be  extracted from only two of these trials (with a total of 66 participants); two  trials were published in the 1980s, and the third in 1993. Nifedipine may be  effective for ""any pain relief"" compared to placebo in women with primary  dysmenorrhoea (odds ratio (OR) 9.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.61 to 31.31;  2 studies, 66 participants; very low-quality evidence). The evidence suggests  that if the rate of pain relief using placebo is 40%, the rate using nifedipine  would be between 64% and 95%. For the outcome of ""good"" or ""excellent"" pain  relief, nifedipine may be more effective than placebo; the confidence interval  was very wide (OR 43.78, 95% CI 5.34 to 259.01; 2 studies, 66 participants; very  low-quality evidence). We are uncertain if the use of nifedipine was associated  with less requirement for additional analgesia use than placebo (OR 0.54, 95% CI  0.07 to 4.20, 1 study, 42 participants; very low-quality evidence). Participants  indicated that they would choose to use nifedipine over their previous analgesic  if the option was available. There were similar levels of adverse effects and  menstruation-related symptoms in the placebo and intervention groups (OR 0.94,  95% CI 0.08 to 10.90; 1 study, 24 participants; very low-quality evidence); if  the chance of adverse effects with placebo is 80%, the rate using nifedipine  would be between 24% and 98%. There were no results regarding formal assessment  of health-related quality of life. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence is insufficient to confirm whether nifedipine  is a possible medical treatment for primary dysmenorrhoea. The trials included  in this review had very low numbers and were of low quality. Notably, there was  a large imbalance in numbers randomised between placebo and treatment groups in  one of the two trials with data available for analysis. While there was no  evidence of a difference noted in adverse effects between groups, more data from  larger participant numbers are needed for this outcome. Larger, more  well-conducted trials are required to elucidate the potential role of nifedipine  in the treatment of this common condition, as it could be a useful addition to  the therapeutic options available if shown to be well tolerated and effective.  The safety of nifedipine in women of reproductive age is well established from  trials of its use in preterm labour, and clinicians are accustomed to off-label  use for this indication. The drug is inexpensive and readily available. Other  options for relief of primary dysmenorrhoea are not suitable for all women;  NSAIDs and the oral contraceptive pill (OCP) are contraindicated for some women,  and the OCP is not suitable for women who are trying to conceive. In addition,  the trials examined suggest there may be a participant preference for  nifedipine.  Copyright © 2021 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons,  Ltd.

Women who  are having menstruation troubles should get their mental health checked by  healthcare specialists. In young women, a menstrual-related condition has  serious health implications. Young females who have menstrual issues miss job  and school, and their behavioural and mental development suffers as a result.  Depression and anxiety have an impact on women's menstrual periods in adults.  Symptoms like as cramps, tiredness, backache, swelling abdomen, and painful  breasts have also been described in women with menstrual misery. Menstrual  distress has been shown to impair women's daily activities, as well as their  reproductive and psychological health, according to research. Menstrual periods  are frequently accompanied by a variety of unpleasant symptoms, such as  premenstrual syndrome, which includes symptoms such as mild cramping and  exhaustion. The severity of these symptoms, on the other hand, differs from  woman to woman, depending on their health, food, way of life, and other factors.  Women with menstrual-related issues have also reported smoking, alcohol intake,  and an increase in hunger. Furthermore, young women experience emotional  disturbances such as melancholy, restlessness, and despair. It is a sign of an  atypical menstrual cycle if there is no cycle or if the bleeding is atypical or  light. As a result, it is critical to maintain contact with a gynaecologist in  order to detect any significant changes in a regular menstrual cycle.  © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

Objectives: This study aimed to assess how menstrual cycle phase and extended  menstrual cycle length influence the incidence of injuries in international  footballers. Methods: Over a 4-year period, injuries from England international  footballers at training camps or matches were recorded, alongside self-reported  information on menstrual cycle characteristics at the point of injury. Injuries  in eumenorrheic players were categorized into early follicular, late follicular,  or luteal phase. Frequencies were also compared between injuries recorded during  the typical cycle and those that occurred after the cycle would be expected to  have finished. Injury incidence rates (per 1,000 person days) and injury  incidence rate ratios were calculated for each phase for all injuries and  injuries stratified by type. Results: One hundred fifty-six injuries from 113  players were eligible for analysis. Injury incidence rates per 1,000 person-days  were 31.9 in the follicular, 46.8 in the late follicular, and 35.4 in the luteal  phase, resulting in injury incidence rate ratios of 1.47 (Late  follicular:Follicular), 1.11 (Luteal:Follicular), and 0.76 (Luteal:Late  follicular). Injury incident rate ratios showed that muscle and tendon injury  rates were 88% greater in the late follicular phase compared to the follicular  phase, with muscle rupture/tear/strain/cramps and tendon injuries/ruptures  occurring over twice as often during the late follicular phase compared to other  phases 20% of injuries were reported as occurring when athletes were ""overdue""  menses. Conclusion: Muscle and tendon injuries occurred almost twice as often in  the late follicular phase compared to the early follicular or luteal phase.  Injury risk may be elevated in typically eumenorrheic women in the days after  their next menstruation was expected to start.  Copyright © 2021 Martin, Timmins, Cowie, Alty, Mehta, Tang and Varley.

Leroy-Melamed M(1), Katz A(2), Shew ML(2).  Author information: (1)Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN. Electronic address:  mmelamed@iu.edu. (2)Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN.  STUDY OBJECTIVE: This study describes menstrual dysfunction and treatment among  adolescent and young adult (AYA) females with congenital heart disease (CHD). DESIGN: Data collected from a 1-time survey completed by AYA females (and  mothers if AYA unable). SETTING: Participants were recruited from pediatric cardiology clinics. PARTICIPANTS: Female AYA with CHD, aged 14-21 years (N = 114). INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The questionnaire assessed sexual and reproductive health  (SRH) concerns, behaviors, and management. Outcome measures were self-reported  menstrual complaints, use of over-the-counter (OTC) pain relief medications for  dysmenorrhea, reported visits with a clinician for a menstrual problem, and  reported use of hormones for menstrual problems or birth control. RESULTS: Mean age was 17.0 years (SD = 2.2). The majority of participants (83%)  reported 1 or more menstrual complaints (67.5% cramping, 42.1% irregular menses,  46.5% heavy periods), and 88% reported any history of taking OTC medications for  pain relief. Increased menstrual complaints were not associated with level of  cardiac complexity, reported transplantation, or reported use of hormonal  contraception. However, 32% of participants reported use of hormonal  contraception for menstrual dysfunction. Combined oral contraceptive pills  (COCs) were the most common; 2 of these women carried contraindications to  estrogen. CONCLUSIONS: A large majority of AYA females with CHD reported menstrual  dysfunction. Use of OTC medication for menstrual pain and inappropriate use of  estrogen creates concerns that menstrual disorders may be unaddressed or  addressed inappropriately. Thus, gynecological needs of adolescents with CHD may  need to be specifically targeted by providers who feel comfortable with this  population and their complex needs.

Electronic address: khademnut@yahoo.com.  Dysmenorrhea, also known as painful periods, or menstrual cramps, is pain during  menstruation. This study was done in young women that assess the association of  serum vitamin D concentration and severity of dysmenorrhea pain. This  descriptive-analytic study conducted on young girls referred to Shahid fakuri  clinic in Tehran. Eligible girls completed the visual analog scale (VAS) and 372  participants with mild, moderate and severe dysmenorrhea completed the study. In  order To measure the serum concentration of 25-hydroxy vitamin D, 5 ml of blood  was be taken from participants. Most of the participants (53.22%) described  their menstrual pain as moderate, while 24.73% and 22.04% of participants  reported severe and mild dysmenorrhea respectively. About 37% of women had Vit D  insufficiency, 36.55% had moderate Vit D deficiency, and 26.34% had severe  deficiency. There was a negative correlation between the serum levels of 25(OH)  D and pain indices (PV: 0.044). Positive relationship between pain intensity and  waist circumference, hip circumference, fat percentage, and fat mass was  observed, but between pain intensity with BMI and WHR no significant  relationship was observed. According to these results supplementation with Vit D  may be useful to girls for decreasing of dysmenorrhea pain.  Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Altered exploratory behaviour and increased food intake in the spiny mouse  before menstruation: a unique pre-clinical model for examining premenstrual  syndrome.

(2)Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Monash University, Clayton, Australia. (3)Centre for Reproductive Health, Hudson Institute of Medical Research,  Clayton, Australia.  STUDY QUESTION: Does the newly discovered menstruating spiny mouse exhibit  behavioural and metabolic changes in correlation with premenstrual phases of the  menstrual cycle? SUMMARY ANSWER: This is the first report of cycle variability in the exploratory  and interactive behaviour, and food consumption in menstruating spiny mice, and  demonstrates that physiological changes are also dependent on within-subject  variation. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a prominent cyclic  disorder that affects millions of women worldwide. More than 70% of women endure  symptoms of impending menstruation, such as bloating, abdominal cramping and  nausea to some degree. Consequently, ~8% of women experience recurrent physical  and emotional symptoms which are extreme enough to disrupt daily life and seek  intervention. Due to a lack of an appropriate animal model, the mechanisms  underlying PMS are poorly understood, and subsequently, effective treatments are  limited. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This study analyses the changes in behavioural  responses to the investigator during vaginal lavage (n = 14), exploratory  behaviour (n = 11) and metabolism (n = 20) across the menstrual cycle in the  spiny mouse (Acomys cahirinus). PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: We performed vaginal lavages on virgin  spiny mice (6-8 months of age) and subjected each cohort of females to repeated  measures for vaginal lavage, exploratory behaviour and metabolism. Stages of the  menstrual cycle were designated as early follicular, late follicular, early  luteal, late luteal, early menstrual and late menstrual, with the late luteal  and early menstrual phases considered as premenstrual phases and analysed using  generalized estimating equations. For vaginal lavage, the behavioural responses  to researcher handling were scored on an increasing scale of severity during the  lavage process (e.g. restraint, frequency of vocalizations, total handling  time). For exploratory behaviour, exploration, memory and sociability were  assessed through subjection to Open Field (OF), Novel Object Recognition (NORT),  Social Novelty (SN) and Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) tests. For metabolism,  physiological changes were measured over a 24-h period in metabolic cages.  Results are mean ± SD with statistical significance set to P < 0.05. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Qualitative behavioural assessment showed  that compared to early follicular controls, during premenstrual phases, cycling  females had significantly increased probability of: manifesting difficulties  during restraint (4×, P < 0.01), vocalizing (8×, P < 0.01) and exhibiting  isolation in the cage (40×, P = 0.041). We saw significant increases in handling  time during the premenstrual phase in cycling females (76 ± 16 s) compared to  controls (55 ± 7 s, P < 0.001). For exploratory behaviour, cycling females in  their early menstrual phase travelled significantly less distance in the outer  zone of the OF arena (13.3 ± 9.0 m) than females in their early luteal phase  (22.3 ± 9.9 m, P = 0.038) and at significantly reduced velocities (40.2 ± 10.5  mm/s and 78.8 ± 31.0 mm/s, respectively, P = 0.006). These females also had  fewer entries into the EPM open arms during the same phases (9.6 ± 6.1 and  versus 20.0 ± 7.2, respectively, P = 0.030) and travelled less distance (3.2 ±  2.8 m versus 7.0 ± 5.5 m, respectively, P = 0.026). No differences were observed  in NORT or SN across the cycle. In the metabolism studies, spiny mice  demonstrated a significant increase in food consumption (percentage of body  weight) during the early follicular and late luteal phases (3.9 ± 2.4% and 3.8 ±  2.1%, respectively) compared to the late follicular phase (2.3 ± 2.6%, P =  0.015). LARGE SCALE DATA: N/A. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This is an observational study to determine  fundamental changes in behaviour and metabolism in a novel species, and as such,  lacks commercially available laboratory reagents and protocols specific to the  spiny mouse. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The timing of these behavioural and  physiological changes suggests that spiny mice exhibit symptoms analogous to PMS  in higher order primates, thus providing a pre-clinical model for testing novel  interventions to alleviate premenstrual symptoms and overcoming many limitations  associated with this research area.

(4)Department of Pediatrics, Division of Adolescent Medicine, Cooper University  Healthcare, Camden, New Jersey.  STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the rates at which primary care providers elicit  menstrual histories from adolescent girls at well visits. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: The departments of Pediatrics, Adolescent Medicine, and Family Medicine  of Cooper University Healthcare from January 1, 2010 to June 1, 2016. PARTICIPANTS: Women aged 12-21 years who were seen for a well visit in the  described setting. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We searched physician well visit notes for documentation  of the following aspects of menstrual history: menarche, last menstrual period,  usual length of cycle, and the presence or absence of associated symptoms (such  as pain and cramps). The presence or absence of each aspect was recorded in a  binary fashion in a deidentified data set. RESULTS: A total of 954 unique charts were analyzed: 415 from Adolescent  Medicine, 289 from Family Medicine, and 250 from General Pediatrics at Cooper  University Healthcare. Adolescent Medicine was 6.44 times more likely to take a  complete menstrual history than Family Medicine (P < .0001) and 5.80 times more  likely than Pediatrics (P < .0001). There was no statistical difference between  Pediatrics and Family Medicine (odds ratio, 0.55; P = .3150). CONCLUSION: Menstrual history-taking is often incomplete and can vary between  departments, even within the same institution. These results indicate  opportunities to raise awareness about the importance of a complete menstrual  history and to develop quality improvement initiatives to increase documentation  of the complete menstrual history.

Approximately 33% of normal-length (21⁻35 days) cycles have subclinical  ovulatory disturbances and lack sufficient progesterone, although their normal  length ensures enough estrogen. Subclinical ovulatory disturbances are related  to significant premenopausal spine bone loss (-0.86%/year). Molimina,  non-distressing premenstrual experiences, may detect ovulation within  normal-length cycles. This prospective study assessed the relationship between  molimina and ovulation. After 1-cycle of daily diary and first morning urine  collections, women answered the Molimina Question (MQ): ""Can you tell by the way  you feel that your period is coming?"" and were invited to share (a) predictive  premenstrual experience(s). A 3-fold increase in follicular-luteal pregnanediol  levels confirmed ovulation. In 610 spontaneously menstruating women (not on  hormonal contraception, mean age 31.5 ± 5.3, menarche age 12.7 ± 1.5, cycle  length [CL] 29 days, MQ positive in 89%), reported premenstrual experiences  which included negative moods (62%), cramps (48%), bloating (39%), and front  (26%) or axillary (25%) breast tenderness. Of 432 women with  pregnanediol-documented cycles, 398 (92%) were ovulatory (CL: 29 ± 5) and 34  (8%) had ovulatory disturbances (CL: 32 ± 14). Women with/without ovulatory  cycles were similar in parity, body mass index, smoking, dietary restraint and  the MQ; ovulatory-disturbed cycles were longer. Molimina did not confirm  ovulation. A non-invasive, inexpensive ovulation indicator is needed to prevent  osteoporosis.

The present study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy  of acupuncture in the management of primary dysmenorrhea. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty females aged 17-23 years were randomly assigned to  either a study group or a control group. The study group received acupuncture  for the duration of 20 minutes/day, for 15 days/month, for the period of 90  days. The control group did not receive acupuncture for the same period.  Baseline, during, and post assessments of both the groups were taken on day 1;  day 30 and day 60; and day 90, respectively. Statistical analysis was performed  by repeated measures of analysis of variance followed by post hoc analysis with  Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons, independent samples t test for  visual analog scale score, and Mann-Whitney U test for rest of the variables  using statistical package for the social sciences, version 16. RESULTS: This study showed a significant reduction in all the variables such as  the visual analog scale score for pain, menstrual cramps, headache, dizziness,  diarrhea, faint, mood changes, tiredness, nausea, and vomiting in the study  group compared with those in the control group. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture could be considered as an effective treatment modality  for the management of primary dysmenorrhea.  Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Adegbayi A(1).  Author information: (1)Redeemer's University, Gbogan-Osogbo Experessway, Akoda, Ede, Osun State,  Nigeria.  The aim of the study is to add to the body of knowledge on less researched  aspects of female adolescent health in Nigeria. It specifically explored the  menarche or first period narratives of 136 young women, focusing on the contents  of the discussion that ensued with whom they told when they first got their  period using qualitative methodology. It also explores sources of premenstrual  information and how the menstrual period is managed. The sample consisted of 136  undergraduate females in Redeemer's University, Ede, Nigeria. Almost all of the  respondents (95%) received information about menstruation from mothers, female  relatives and school lessons prior to menarche. The majority of the respondents  first told either their mother or a female relative when they first got their  period and viewed menarche as a crisis. Two salient themes emerged from the  contents of the narratives; celebration and advice. The advice theme was further  explored and three advice patterns were identified: being a woman, hygiene and  changed dynamics in relationships with males. Data from the present study  suggests that only certain aspects of the menstruation discourse have evolved.  All respondents reported using sanitary towels during their menstrual period  with the majority experiencing cramps regularly and (61%) using pharmalogical  agents for remedy. It is envisaged that findings from the study will be useful  in future health intervention programmes and research on female adolescent  health in Nigeria and elsewhere.

Primary dysmenorrhea (PD), as characterized by painful menstrual cramps without  organic causes, is associated with central sensitization and brain function  changes. Previous studies showed the integrated role of the default mode network  (DMN) in the pain connectome and its key contribution on how an individual  perceives and copes with pain disorders. Here, we aimed to investigate whether  the cingulum bundle connecting hub regions of the DMN was disrupted in young  women with PD. Diffusion tensor imaging was obtained in 41 PD patients and 41  matched healthy controls (HC) during their periovulatory phase. The production  of prostaglandins (PGs) was obtained in PD patients during their pain-free and  pain phases. As compared with HC, PD patients had similar scores of pain  intensity, anxiety, and depression in their pain-free phase. However, altered  white matter properties mainly located in the posterior section of the cingulum  bundle were observed in PD. Besides PGs being related to menstrual pain, a close  relationship was found between the white matter properties of the cingulum  bundle during the pain-free phase and the severity of the menstrual pain in PD  patients. Our study suggested that PD had trait changes of white matter  integrities in the cingulum bundle that persisted beyond the time of  menstruation. We inferred that altered anatomical connections may lead to  less-flexible communication within the DMN, and/or between the DMN and other  pain-related brain networks, which may result in the central susceptibility to  develop chronic pain conditions in PD's later life.

INTRODUCTION: Dysmenorrhea is a condition describing the painful cramps that  women feel before or during the menstrual period. While dysmenorrhea is the most  common gynecologic complaint affecting adolescent and young women and there has  been significant progress in understanding its pathophysiology and managing the  symptoms, many young women do not seek medical consultation and remain  untreated. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of the study was to explore the prevalence of  dysmenorrhea, its physical impact, and associated coping behaviors among  university students. METHODS: A total of 269 female college students volunteered to participate in  the study. Data regarding the students' experience with dysmenorrhea were  collected via self-reported questionnaire developed based on relevant  literature. Pain was scored on visual analog scale (VAS). RESULTS: Most respondents (84.01%) reported feeling pain in the abdomen and back  (VAS score, 5.00). Mood swings (84.8%) and dizziness (48.2%) were, respectively,  the most common affective and somatic symptoms related to menstruation. There  was a significant difference in the amount of menstrual flow (p=0.004) and  incidence of dysmenorrhea (p=0.03) according to menstrual regularity. Most  students (91.2%) did not seek medical consultation for dysmenorrhea, and 62.4%  used analgesics. However, no significant correlation (p=0.25) was found between  analgesic intake and pain relief. While most students (90.7%) did not miss  exams, 48.7% reported poor satisfaction with their academic performance because  of dysmenorrhea. CONCLUSION: Dysmenorrhea is highly prevalent among college students, with many  physical impacts and associated activity limitations. Collaborative efforts from  health care providers, program coordinators, and parents should focus on  increasing awareness and improving management strategies to treat dysmenorrhea.

The development of pain is common in midlife, resulting in increased health care  utilization and costs. The aim of this study was to determine the longitudinal  trajectory of overall bodily pain among women during the transition between the  reproductive years and menopause. We conducted analyses on a community-based,  longitudinal cohort of women enrolled in the Study of Women's Health Across the  Nation. One thousand four hundred ninety-five women met inclusion criteria,  including: 1) defined date of the final menstrual period (FMP), and 2) complete  data on Short Form-36 bodily pain. The primary exposure was time to/from the  FMP. The primary outcome was the rate of change in Short Form-36 bodily pain,  measured on a scale of 0 to 100 with 100 being the most severe pain. We  performed within-person trajectory analyses using piecewise regression following  nonparametric modeling of functional forms. Mean bodily pain score at the time  of the FMP was 29. Mean bodily pain increased at a rate of .26 per year during  the transmenopause (the interval spanning 4.5 years before the FMP through  .5 years after the FMP), and decreased at a rate of .23 per year after that.  Depression and sleep problems were associated with greater increases in pain  during the late reproductive years, whereas abdominal cramps at baseline  predicted greater decreases in pain during the late reproductive years. PERSPECTIVE: This article shows that bodily pain increases during the  transmenopause and then diminishes during postmenopause. These differences may  reflect differences in underlying mechanisms of pain in the 2 periods. Although  mean changes were small and unlikely to be clinically meaningful, the magnitude  of change varied across subgroups of women.  Copyright © 2016 American Pain Society.

One hundred and twenty years after the description of extracts from the adrenal  medulla, the use of beta-blockers and beta-agonists evolved from antianginal  drugs and tocolytics to ligand-directed signaling. Beta-blockers in the fields  of obstetrics and gynecology have so far been limited to the consideration of  continuing treatment of disorders of the cardiovascular system and other  dysfunctions that started before pregnancy. Studies in recent years have shown  that beta-adrenoceptor signaling might be crucial in carcinogenesis and  metastasis, apoptosis and anoikis. On the other hand, the use of  beta-adrenoceptor agonists in tocolysis is, as yet, the primary method for  inhibiting premature uterine contractions. Unfortunately, the efficacy of  current pharmacological treatment for the management of preterm labor is  regularly questioned. Moreover, studies related to non-pregnant myometrium  performed to date indicate that the rhythmic contractions of the uterus are  required for menstruation and have an important role in human reproduction. In  turn, abnormal uterine contractility has been linked to dysmenorrhea, a  condition associated with painful uterine cramping. The benefits of the use of  beta2-adrenoceptor agonists in dysmenorrhea are still unclear and should be  balanced against a wide range of adverse effects recognized with this class of  medication. The ideal tocolytic agent is one which is effective for the pregnant  or non-pregnant woman but has no side effects on either the woman or the baby.  Looking to the future with both caution and hope, the potential metamorphosis of  beta3-adrenoceptor agonists from experimental tools into therapeutic drugs for  tocolysis warrants attention.

BACKGROUND: Primary dysmenorrhoea is the most common form of period pain and  affects up to three-quarters of women at some stage of their reproductive life.  Primary dysmenorrhoea is pain in the absence of any organic cause and is  characterised by cramping pain in the lower abdomen, starting within the first  eight to 72 hours of menstruation.This review examines the currently available  evidence supporting the use of acupuncture (stimulation of points on the body  using needles) and acupressure (stimulation of points on the body using  pressure) to treat primary dysmenorrhoea. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture and  acupressure in the treatment of primary dysmenorrhoea when compared with a  placebo, no treatment, or conventional medical treatment. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Menstrual  Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register (to September 2015), Cochrane  Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE,  EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Chinese databases including Chinese Biomedical  Literature Database (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP  database and registers of ongoing trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all published and unpublished randomised  controlled trials (RCTs) comparing acupuncture with sham acupuncture or placebo  control, usual care, pharmacological treatment or no treatment. We included the  following modes of treatment: acupuncture, electro-acupuncture, and acupressure.  Participants were women of reproductive age with primary dysmenorrhoea during  the majority of the menstrual cycles or for three consecutive menstrual cycles,  and moderate to severe symptoms. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We calculated odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous  outcomes and mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs) for  continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We pooled the data  where appropriate. Our primary outcomes was pain. Secondary outcomes included  menstrual symptoms, quality of life, and adverse effects. MAIN RESULTS: We included 42 RCTs (4640 women). Acupuncture or acupressure was  compared with a sham/placebo group, medication, no treatment or other treatment.  Many of the continuous data were not suitable for calculation of means, mainly  due to evidence of skew.1. Acupuncture studies Acupuncture versus sham or  placebo control (6 RCTs)Findings were inconsistent and inconclusive. However,  the only study in the review that was at low risk of bias in all domains found  no evidence of a difference between the groups at three, six or 12 months. The  overall quality of the evidence was low. No studies reported adverse events.  Acupuncture versus NSAIDs Seven studies reported visual analogue scale (VAS)  pain scores, but were unsuitable for pooling due to extreme heterogeneity (I² =  94%). In all studies the scores were lower in the acupuncture group, with the  mean difference varying across studies from 0.64 to 4 points on a VAS 0 - 10  scale (low-quality evidence). Four RCTs reported rates of pain relief, and found  a benefit for the acupuncture group (OR 4.99, 95% CI 2.82 to 8.82, 352 women, I²  = 0%, low-quality evidence). Adverse events were less common in the acupuncture  group (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.44, 4 RCTs, 239 women, 4 trials, I² = 15%,  low-quality evidence). Acupuncture versus no treatment Data were unsuitable for  analysis, but pain scores were lower in the acupuncture group in all six studies  reporting this outcome. The quality of the evidence was low. No studies reported  adverse events.2. Acupressure studiesNo studies of acupressure reported adverse  events. Acupressure versus sham or placebo controlData were unsuitable for  pooling, but two studies reported a mean benefit of one to three points on a 0 -  10 VAS pain scale. Another four studies reported data unsuitable for analysis:  all found that pain scores were lower in the acupuncture group. No studies  reported adverse events. The quality of the evidence was low. Acupressure versus  NSAIDsOne study reported this outcome, using a 0 - 3 pain scale. The score was  higher (indicating more pain) in the acupressure group (MD 0.39 points, 95% CI  0.21 to 0.57, 136 women, very low-quality evidence). Acupressure versus no  treatmentThere was no clear evidence of a difference between the groups on a VAS  0 - 10 pain scale (MD -0.96 points, 95% CI -2.54 to 0.62, 2 trials, 140 women,  I² = 83%, very low-quality evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to demonstrate whether or  not acupuncture or acupressure are effective in treating primary dysmenorrhoea,  and for most comparisons no data were available on adverse events. The quality  of the evidence was low or very low for all comparisons. The main limitations  were risk of bias, poor reporting, inconsistency and risk of publication bias.

(6)Department of Radiology, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taiwan.  BACKGROUND: Primary dysmenorrhoea (PDM) is inexorably common. PDM women suffer  from cramping pain in the lower abdomen that starts with menstruation and lasts  for 24-72 h. Up to 90% of adolescent girls and more than 50% of menstruating  women worldwide report suffering from it. Ten to 20% of PDM women describe their  suffering as severe and distressing. However, nothing is known regarding the  association of PDM with possible brain anomalies or abnormalities. METHODS: High-resolution T1-weighted anatomical brain magnetic resonance images  (MRI) were acquired for each subject and inspected for incidental findings  (normal variants and abnormalities) as a routine procedure in our PDM-related  multimodal neuroimaging studies. Altogether, 330 right-handed young women  [otherwise healthy PDMs = 163; non-PDM healthy controls (HCs) = 167] were  enrolled during the period of 2006-2014. Binomial proportion test was performed  for between-group comparisons. RESULTS: PDMs demonstrated significantly higher prevalence of overall incidental  brain MRI findings (PDMs: n = 18, 11.0%; HCs: n = 6, 3.6%; p = 0.005) that  should be ascribed to a preponderance of normal variants (PDMs: n = 16, 9.8%;  HCs: n = 3, 1.8%; p = 0.001), especially cavum septum pellucidum. No significant  between-group difference of abnormal findings was found (PDMs: n = 2, 1.2%; HCs:  n = 3, 1.8%; p = 0.336). CONCLUSIONS: We report here that otherwise healthy PDMs are associated with high  prevalence of normal variants but not brain abnormalities. Our observations  invite further epidemiological and neuroscientific studies.  © 2014 European Pain Federation - EFIC®  DOI: 10.1002/ejp.639 PMID: 25487523 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Limited scientific evidence supports the positive effects of  traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for treating dysmenorrhea. Thus, an  observation period of 3 months could verify the ancient indication that TCM  treatments effectively alleviate menstrual cramps in women with primary  dysmenorrhea or endometriosis. Methods. A prospective, nonrandomized study  (primary dysmenorrhea and endometriosis groups) was conducted in women with  dysmenorrhea for more than three consecutive menstrual cycles. All patients  received TCM prescriptions based on bian zheng lun zhi theory 14 days before  menstruation for a period of 12 weeks. Pain intensity was evaluated using a  10-cm visual analogue scale and two validated questionnaires (the Menstrual  Distress Questionnaire and the World Health Organization Quality of Life  questionnaire). Results. Of the initial 70 intent-to-treat participants, the  women with dysmenorrhea reported significant alleviation of cramps during  menstruation after the 12-week TCM treatment. Mixed model analysis revealed that  TCM prescriptions were more effective in alleviating fatigue, hot flashes,  dizziness, painful breasts, excitement, and irritability in the primary  dysmenorrhea group (N = 36) than in the endometriosis group (N = 34).  Conclusion. TCM prescriptions based on syndrome differentiation theory might be  a potentially viable choice for treating painful menstruation and premenstrual  symptoms after ruling out endometriosis.

BACKGROUND: Depression during pregnancy or after childbirth is the most frequent  perinatal illness affecting women. We investigated the length distribution of a  trinucleotide repeat in RAI1, which has not been studied in perinatal depression  or in the Chinese population. METHODS: Cases (n=139) with confirmed diagnosis of clinical (major) depression  related to pregnancy/postpartum were recruited from the outpatient clinic.  Controls were patients who came to the obstetrics clinics and scored <7 on the  Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) (n=540). Saliva samples for DNA  analysis, demographic information and self-reported frequency of occurrence of  various premenstrual/menstrual symptoms were collected from all participants.  Genomic DNA was extracted from saliva and relevant region sequenced to determine  the number of CAG/CAA repeats that encodes the polyglutamine tract in the N  terminal of the protein. Difference between groups was assessed by chi-square  analysis for categorical variables and analysis of variance for quantitative  scores. RESULTS: Compared to control subjects, patients with perinatal depression  reported more frequent mood changes, cramps, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and  headache during premenstrual/menstrual periods (p=0.000). For the RAI1 gene  CAG/CAA repeat, there was a statistically significant difference in the  genotypic distribution between cases and controls (p=0.031). There was also a  statistically significant association between the 14-repeat allele and perinatal  depression (p=0.016). LIMITATIONS: Family history, previous mental illness, and physical and  psychological symptoms during the premenstrual/menstrual periods were  self-reported. EPDS screening was done only once for controls. CONCLUSIONS: The RAI1 gene polyglutamine repeat has a different distribution in  our population. The 14-repeat allele is associated with perinatal depression and  more frequent experience of physical and psychological symptoms during menstrual  period.  Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Altern Ther Health Med. 2014 Jan-Feb;20(1):49-56.  An innovative acupuncture treatment for primary dysmenorrhea: a randomized,  crossover pilot study.  Chao MT, Wade CM, Abercrombie PD, Gomolak D.  CONTEXT: Dysmenorrhea, the occurrence of painful menstrual cramping of the  uterus, is a major cause of activity restriction and absences from school and  work among young women. Standard pharmaceuticals used to treat dysmenorrhea are  not effective for all women and have side effects that limit their use. Studies  elsewhere have shown beneficial effects for use of vitamin K1 as an acupoint  treatment, but the acceptability of this treatment to women in the United States  has been unknown. OBJECTIVE: The study intended to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and  preliminary effects of acupuncture point injection of vitamin K1 as an  alternative treatment for primary dysmenorrhea among US women. DESIGN: The research team conducted a pilot study using a blinded, randomized,  crossover trial design. SETTING: The study took place at the University of California, San Francisco  (UCSF). PARTICIPANTS: The study was conducted in the San Francisco Bay Area among women  18 to 25 y of age who had been diagnosed with primary dysmenorrhea. Fourteen  women completed all of the study's visits. INTERVENTION: Women with primary dysmenorrhea were randomized into 2 groups to  receive bilateral injections of vitamin K1 in the Spleen-6 (SP-6) acupuncture  point at the start of menstruation and then, following a 2-mo washout period,  saline in a nonacupuncture point at the start of menstruation. One group  received the vitamin K1 injection first, while the other group received the  saline injection first. OUTCOME MEASURE: Dysmenorrhea pain intensity was measured using a 0-10 numeric  rating scale (NRS), before and after injections. RESULTS: Women had an average 2.5-point decrease in pain after a vitamin K1  injection in the SP-6 acupoint (P < .001), as compared with a 1.8-point decrease  after a saline injection (P < .001). Change scores for vitamin K1, as compared  with a saline injection, approached statistical significance (P < .10).  Intensity and duration of menstrual symptoms, as measured by the Cox  retrospective symptom scale, also decreased following injections. After  participating, 94% of the women remained agreeable to receiving the injection  therapy, and 77% reported they would come every month were the treatment  available. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggested high acceptability for an acupuncture point  injection of vitamin K1 as treatment for primary dysmenorrhea among young women  in San Francisco. Pain decreased with both treatments, with a trend toward  greater pain reduction for the vitamin K1/SP-6 injection. This finding is  consistent with outcomes from the Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital in  Shanghai, China, where the protocol was developed.  PMCID: PMC3898591 PMID: 24445356 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

PURPOSE: Primary dysmenorrhea, which refers to painful, spasmodic cramping in  the lower abdomen just before/or during menstruation, is the most common  gynecological complaint in women of reproductive age. Non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory drugs have been prescribed as the first-line therapy for pain  relief from dysmenorrhea. We aimed to investigate the efficacy of the daily  recommended dose (150 mg) of diclofenac potassium, administered at set intervals  across the first 24 h of menstruation, in treating severe menstrual pain in 24  women with severe primary dysmenorrhea. METHODS: In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind cross-over study,  women rated their menstrual pain intensity on a 100-mm visual analog scale  across set time intervals over a 24-h period. RESULTS: Menstrual pain intensity was significantly reduced after taking the  first capsule of diclofenac, and remained consistently lower (P < 0.0001),  compared with initial pain intensity, in the morning (before treatment),  throughout the day, evening, and into the next morning. Also, women rated their  pain intensity as significantly lower (P < 0.001) at each time point across the  24-h time interval of the cycle when receiving diclofenac compared with the  cycle when they received placebo. No woman required rescue medication when  taking diclofenac potassium compared with six women taking rescue medications  during the placebo trial. When taking only placebo, women rated their menstrual  pain intensity as persistently severe across the first 24 h of menstruation. CONCLUSION: These results show that the recommended daily dose of diclofenac  potassium, in three 50 mg doses across the day and evening, offers effective  menstrual pain relief across 24 h, compared with placebo, in women with severe  primary dysmenorrhea.

Author information: (1)Department Obstetric and Gynecology, University of Pavia, Italy.  renappi@tin.it  BACKGROUND: Combined hormonal contraception might worsen migraine in sensitive  women, especially during the free-hormone interval, and raise concerns about the  vascular risk. The characteristics of a contraceptive pill containing estradiol  valerate/dienogest (E2V/DNG) might be of potential benefit in women with  menstrually related migraine (MRM) who choose to use oral contraception for  birth control. STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective diary-based pilot study. Thirty-two women  (age >35 years) [n=18 who had never used combined oral contraceptives (COCs) and  n=14 who had previously used COCs] diagnosed with MRMs according to the  International Headache Society criteria were included. During the observational  period, women filled in a diary with the clinical characteristics of migraine  attacks. After a three-cycle run-in period, each subject received a COC  containing E2V/DNG (Qlaira®/Natazia®; Bayer HealthCare, Berlin, Germany)  administered using an estrogen step-down and progestogen step-up approach.  Follow-up evaluations were scheduled at the last cycle of run-in and at the  third and sixth cycles of treatment. RESULTS: The number of migraine attacks was significantly reduced at the third  (p<.001) and sixth cycles (p<.001) in comparison with the run-in period. A  similar result was evident for the duration (p<.001 at the third and p<.001 at  the sixth cycle) as well as for the severity of head pain (p<.001 at the third  and p<.001 at the sixth month). Indeed, a significantly lower number of  analgesics were used at the third cycle (p<.001) in comparison with baseline,  and a further decrease was evident at the sixth cycle (p<.001) in comparison  with the third cycle of E2V/DNG use. Interestingly, duration and severity of  head pain were significantly correlated with the number of days of dysmenorrhea  at the third cycle (r=.89, p=.000 and r=.67, p=.02; respectively) and at the  sixth cycle (r=.76, p=.000 and r=.62, p=.04; respectively) in women without  complete remission of menstrual cramps during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: The present diary-based pilot study indicates that the use of a  pill containing EV2/DNG for six cycles has a positive effect in women with MRM  and suggests an association between dysmenorrhea with COCs use as a potential  feature of refractory head pain.

[Six-month follow-up of the effect of neomenor in patients with painful  menstruation].  [Article in Bulgarian]  Sirakov M, Karamisheva V, Ivanov S.  Neomenor is herbal medication especially created to permanently relieve painful  menstruation symptoms in girls and women with primary dysmenorrhea. It supplies  the organism with substances essential for the metabolic processes that  guarantee normal menstrual cycles. In some women these substances are out of  balance, there is an excess of prostaglandins, which leads to painful periods,  menstrual cramps and even migraine. Each NEOMENOR tablet contains 400 mg of  standardized extracts from stalks of: Astragalus glycypyhyllos (Wild liquorice),  Erodium cicutarium (Redstem Stork's Bill) and Geranium sanguineum (Bloody  Cranesbill). Their biologically active substances inhibit the synthesis of  prostaglandins and their secretion into the uterus, hence strong muscle  contractions are reduced and menstrual cramps disappear. The aim of this short  study is to gain personal impressions about the action of the preparation. We  have tested 35 girls and women with middle-age--18.74 on (14-28 years) with  menarche--average at 12.8, suffering of primary dysmenorrhea. We have watched  following factors: degree of dysmenorrhea, duration of complaints, habitus,  gynecological and mental status, used painkillers. As a result of three months  treatment 63% of the patients with III-d and 37% with II-nd grade of  dysmenorrhea transformed in 42% with II-nd and 45% with I-st grade of  dysmenorrhea. Only in 4 patients (11%) therapy was without success. The  monitoring continues.  PMID: 21695945 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Author information: (1)Division of Epidemiology, Statistics and Prevention Research, NICHD, NIH,  DHHS, Bethesda, Maryland, USA. gollenba@mail.nih.gov  OBJECTIVE: To examine the longitudinal relation between perceived stress in the  previous month and perimenstrual symptom severity across two cycles among  regularly menstruating, healthy women (n = 259). METHODS: At baseline (11 days before the first cycle), participants completed  the 4-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) for the previous month (first cycle  exposure) and questionnaires on lifestyle factors. On cycle day 22 of a  standardized 28-day cycle, participants again completed the PSS for the previous  week (second cycle exposure) and each week rated the severity (none, mild,  moderate, severe) of 17 psychological and physical symptoms (e.g., crying,  cramping, pain). Mixed models estimated the association between perceived stress  scores and number of moderate/severe symptoms and symptom severity scores,  allowing both stress and perimenstrual symptoms to vary by cycle. RESULTS: Adjusting for age, education, passive and active smoking, and  waist/height ratio (WHtR), high stress (fourth quartile PSS) was associated with  an increased risk of reporting >or=8 or more (OR 7.2, 3.3-15.8) and >or=5 (OR  2.5, 1.6-4.1) symptoms as moderate/severe during the perimenstrual period  compared with lower stress (quartiles one, two, and three). Stress scores were  positively (p < 0.0001) associated with increased symptom severity scores for  total, psychological, and physical symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: These analyses show that higher perceived stress precedes an  increased severity of perimenstrual symptoms. Stress reduction programs may be  an effective, nonpharmaceutical treatment for physical and psychological symptom  relief.

Author information: (1)Dipartimento di Psicologia DPSS, Università Degli Studi di Padova, via  Venezia 8, 35131 Padova, Italy. jeff.kiesner@unipd.it  The associations between physical and psychological symptoms of the menstrual  cycle have not been carefully studied in past research, but may lead to a better  understanding of the underlying mechanisms of these symptoms. The present study  examines the day-to-day co-variations among physical and psychological symptoms  of the menstrual cycle. These symptoms were evaluated on a daily basis across  one entire menstrual cycle, with a non-clinical sample of 92 university  students. Results showed that headaches, gastrointestinal problems, lower  abdominal bloating, skin changes, and breast changes, were all significantly  associated with higher levels of psychological symptoms; whereas back and joint  pain, lower abdominal cramps, cervical mucous, and menstrual flow, were not  associated with psychological symptoms. However, significant differences in  these associations were observed across individuals for back and joint pain,  headaches, lower abdominal cramps, skin changes, and menstrual flow: Whereas  some women demonstrated higher levels of psychological symptoms associated with  these physical symptoms, other women demonstrated lower levels of psychological  symptoms. Finally, correlations among the associations between physical and  psychological symptoms (slopes) demonstrated clear differences across the  different physical symptoms. These results indicate that, although higher levels  of some physical symptoms are associated with higher levels of psychological  symptoms, there are significant differences in the magnitude and direction of  these relations across individuals. Further consideration of physical symptoms  may provide useful information for understanding individual differences in  symptom profiles and response to steroid fluctuations, and for improving  differential diagnosis and treatment planning and evaluation.

Tu CH(1), Niddam DM, Chao HT, Liu RS, Hwang RJ, Yeh TC, Hsieh JC.  Author information: (1)Institute of Neuroscience, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.  Primary dysmenorrhea (PDM, menstrual pain without pelvic abnormality) is the  most common gynecological disorder for women in the reproductive age. It is  characterized by cramping pain and enhanced pain sensitivity during the  menstruation period. PDM has been associated with peripheral and central  sensitization. Abnormal brain mechanisms may further contribute to development  and maintenance of the state. Using fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission  tomography, increased activity was observed in prefrontal/orbitofrontal regions  and left ventral posterior thalamus while decreased activity mainly was observed  in sensorimotor regions of the left hemisphere at onset compared to offset of  PDM. These results were specific to menstrual pain and were not found in  menstrual matched controls. Orbitofrontal activities were positively related to  while somatosensory activities where negatively related to subjective pain  ratings. These results show that ongoing menstrual pain in PDM is accompanied by  abnormal brain metabolism. Disinhibition of thalamo-orbitofrontal-prefrontal  networks may contribute to the generation of pain and hyperalgesia in PDM  possibly by maintaining spinal and thalamic sensitization while increasing  negative affect. Excessive excitatory input during menstrual pain may induce  compensatory inhibitory mechanism in several somatic sensorimotor regions.

Exercise and primary dysmenorrhoea : a comprehensive and critical review of the  literature.  Daley AJ(1).  Author information: (1)The Department of Primary Care and General Practice, The Medical School,  University of Birmingham Clinical Sciences Building, Birmingham, UK.  a.daley@bham.ac.uk  Primary dysmenorrhoea (PD) is chronic, cyclic, pelvic, spasmodic pain associated  with menstruation in the absence of identifiable pathology and is typically  known as menstrual cramps or period pain. PD is the most common gynaecological  disorder in menstruating women. Despite treatments being available for PD,  relatively few women consult a clinician about their symptoms, preferring not to  use treatment, or to self-treat using non-pharmacological or over-the-counter  interventions. The notion that exercise is effective in preventing and treating  symptoms has prevailed for many years and led to the promotion of anecdotal  belief that exercise is beneficial. Behavioural interventions such as exercise  may not only reduce dysmenorrhoea, but also eliminate or reduce the need for  medication to control menstrual cramps and other associated symptoms. With  emphasis on data from experimental studies, this report seeks to review the  available evidence regarding the role of exercise in the management of PD and  menstruation-related symptomatology. Using key search terms, online  bibliographical databases were searched from the beginning of each database to 1  April 2007. Despite the widespread belief that exercise can reduce PD, empirical  support is limited. Evidence from observational studies was mixed. Several  observational studies reported that physical activity/exercise was associated  with reduced prevalence of dysmenorrhoea, although numerous other studies found  no significant association between outcomes. Evidence from controlled trials  suggests that exercise can reduce PD and associated symptoms, but these have  been small and of low methodological quality. There are, however, several  plausible mechanisms by which exercise might be effective in the management of  PD. A large randomized controlled trial is required before women and clinicians  are advised that exercise is likely to be effective in reducing PD and related  menstrual symptoms.

Pierzyński P(1), Swiatecka J, Oczeretko E, Laudański P, Batra S, Laudański T.  Author information: (1)Department of Pathophysiology of Pregnancy, Medical University of Bialystok,  Bialystok, Poland.  Current treatment of painful periods and other symptoms related to primary  dysmenorrhea (PD) is usually commenced with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory  drugs or oral contraceptives, which fails in about 10% of affected patients.  Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen-receptor modulator (SERM), has been demonstrated  to directly inhibit uterine contractions, causing improvement in uterine blood  flow. It could be considered for application in selected groups of dysmenorrheic  patients, for instance carriers of breast cancer-associated antigen (BRCA)  genes, breast cancer survivors or women with advanced endometriosis. Thus the  aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of short-term treatment  with tamoxifen on PD and PD-related symptoms, as well as its direct effect on  parameters of intrauterine pressure during the painful menstruation, in a group  of dysmenorrheic patients. After two cycles of administration of tamoxifen we  noted a significant decrease in bleeding together with reductions in the  severity of menstrual cramps, diarrhea, headache, fatigue and anxiety. In  intrauterine pressure assessments, tamoxifen significantly decreased propagation  of uterine contractions. In conclusion, SERMs such as tamoxifen may constitute a  therapeutic option in selected groups of patients, improving dysmenorrheic  symptoms. Additionally to its receptor-mediated effects, tamoxifen was shown to  exert a direct influence on uterine contractile activity that may explain the  decrease of menstrual pain and cramps noted in the studied group.

11139745,Sex hormones and headache.,Silberstein SD,"1. Rev Neurol (Paris). 2000;156 Suppl 4:4S30-41.  Sex hormones and headache.  Silberstein SD(1).  Author information: (1)Jefferson Headache Center, Thomas Jefferson University Hospital,  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Stephen.Silberstein@mail.tju.edu  The normal female life cycle is associated with a number of hormonal milestones:  menarche, pregnancy, contraceptive use, menopause, and the use of replacement  sex hormones. Menarche marks the onset of menses and cyclic changes in hormone  levels. Pregnancy is associated with rising noncyclic levels of sex hormones,  and menopause with declining noncyclic levels. Hormonal contraceptive use during  the reproductive years and hormone replacement in menopause are therapeutic  hormonal interventions that alter the levels and cycling of sex hormones. These  events and interventions may cause a change in the prevalence or intensity of  headache. The menstrual cycle is the result of a carefully orchestrated sequence  of interactions between the hypothalamus, pituitary, ovary, and endometrium,  with the sex hormones acting as modulators and effectors at each level. Estrogen  and progestins have potent effects on central serotonergic and opioid neurons,  modulating both neuronal activity and receptor density. The primary trigger of  Menstrually-related migraine (MM) appears to be the withdrawal of estrogen  rather than the maintenance of sustained high or low estrogen levels. However,  changes in the sustained estrogen levels with pregnancy (increased) and  menopause (decreased) appear to affect headaches. Headaches associated with OC  use or menopausal hormonal replacement therapy may be related, in part, to  periodic discontinuation of oral sex hormone preparations. The treatment of  migraine associated with changes in sex hormone levels is frequently difficult  and the patients are often refractory to therapy. Based on what is known of the  pathophysiology of migraine, we have attempted to provide a logical approach to  the treatment of headaches that are associated with menses, menopause, and OCs  using abortive and preventive medications and hormonal manipulations.  Considerable evidence suggests a link between estrogen and progesterone, the  female sex hormones, and migraine. (Silberstein and Merriam, 1997; Lipton and  Stewart, 1993; Epstein et al., 1975; Goldstein and Chen, 1982; Selby and Lance,  1960) Although no gender difference is apparent in prepubertal children, with  migraine occurring equally in 4p. 100 of boys and girls, (Goldstein and Chen,  1982, Waters and O'Connor, 1971) migraine occurs more frequently in adult women  (18p. 100) than in men (6p. 100). (Lipton and Stewart, 1993) Migraine develops  most frequently in the second decade, with the peak incidence occurring with  adolescence. (Selby and Lance, 1960; Epstein et al., 1975) Menstrually-related  migraine (MM) begins at menarche in 33p. 100 of affected women (Epstein et al. ,  1975). MM occurs mainly at the time of menses in many migrainous women, and  exclusively with menses (true menstrual migraine [TMM]) in some (Epstein et al.,  1975). Menstrual migraine can be associated with other somatic complaints  arising before and often persisting into menses, such as nausea, backache,  breast tenderness, and cramps and like them appears to be the result of falling  sex hormone levels (Silberstein and Merriam, 1997; American Psychiatric  Association, 1994). In addition, premenstrual migraine can be associated with  premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PDD), also called ""premenstrual syndrome""  (PMS), which is distinct from the physical symptoms of the perimenstrual period  and is probably not directly driven by declining progesterone levels (Mortola,  1998). Migraine occurring during (rather than prior to) menstruation is usually  not associated with PMS (Silberstein and Merriam, 1997). Migraine may worsen  during the first trimester of pregnancy and, although many women become  headache-free during the last two trimesters, 25p. 100 have no change in their  migraine (Silberstein, 1997). MM typically improves with pregnancy, perhaps due  to sustained high estrogen levels (Silberstein, 1997). Hormonal replacement with  estrogens can exacerbate migraine and oral contraceptives (OCs) can change its  character and frequency  PMID: 11139745 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Kritz-Silverstein D(1), Wingard DL, Garland FC.  Author information: (1)Department of Family and Preventive Medicine, University of California San  Diego, La Jolla, USA.  The present study examines the association of obesity, cigarette smoking,  alcohol consumption, and exercise with the prevalence of menstrual cycle  disorders among 2912 women aboard U.S. Navy ships. Self-administered surveys  obtained information on weight, height, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption,  and exercise. Participants also indicated whether they experienced cramps or  pain during their period requiring medication or time off work, bleeding between  periods, excessive frequency of periods, heavy periods, periods lasting for  longer than a week, scanty menstrual flow, and irregular periods during the past  90 days. Women ranged in age from 18 to 49 years, with an average of 26 years.  After adjustment for age, race, and pay grade, current cigarette smoking was  associated with increased risk of all menstrual symptoms and cycle disorders. As  compared with nonsmokers, current smokers were at increased risk of cramps or  pain requiring medication or time off work (odds ratio [OR] = 1.13, 95%  confidence interval [CI] = 1.03, 1.25), bleeding between periods (OR = 1.22, CI  = 1.09, 1.38), excessive frequency of periods (OR = 1.33, CI = 1.17, 1.51),  heavy periods (OR = 1.17, CI = 1.06, 1.29), periods lasting longer than a week  (OR = 1.31, CI = 1.16, 1.48), scanty flow (OR = 1.13, CI = 1.01, 1.29), and  irregular periods (OR = 1.14, CI = 1.05, 1.24). Obesity, exercise, and alcohol  consumption did not show consistent associations with menstrual symptoms or  cycle disorders. Logistic regression models that included age, race, pay grade,  and all behavioral and lifestyle variables indicated only cigarette smoking was  associated with an increased risk of bleeding between periods (OR = 1.33, CI =  1.05, 1.68), excessive frequency of periods (OR = 1.38, CI = 1.21, 1.58),  periods lasting longer than a week (OR = 1.45, CI = 1.13, 1.84), and irregular  periods (OR = 1.25, CI = 1.05, 1.47). Although the lifestyle factors are all  potentially modifiable, results suggest that only interventions targeted at  smoking cessation might be useful in reducing the prevalence of menstrual  symptoms, cycle disorders, and time lost from work.

Hormonal contraceptive methods  and the IUD affect menstruation. Hormonal methods also interfere with ovulation.  Combined oral contraceptives (OCs) suppress ovulation and can reduce the number  of days of menstrual bleeding and minimize menstrual cramps and premenstrual  syndrome symptoms. They can effect changes in bleeding patterns. Progestin-only  contraceptives may also effect menstrual changes and ease menstrual cramps.  Counseling on possible effects of progestin-only contraceptives is needed to  minimize their discontinuation. Women can use emergency contraception (some OCs)  within 48 or 72 hours of unprotected intercourse (e.g., rape), depending on OC  type, and again 12 hours later to prevent unwanted pregnancy. An advisory  committee of the US Food and Drug Administration has recently recommended the  use of some OCs for emergency use. IUDs thwart sperm movement and viability. IUD  users tend to have increased menstrual bleeding and pain. IUDs with synthetic  progestin reduce these effects. Female sterilization methods do not affect  ovulation but may induce changes in bleeding patterns or cause painful periods.  Providers should inform clients which genital symptoms are normal and which are  not. For example, purulent vaginal discharge may be a sign of a sexually  transmitted disease (STD). Untreated STDs may lead to pelvic inflammatory  disease. Changes in cervical secretions call for clients to seek medical advice.  PMID: 12320448 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Erratum in     Int J Fertil Menopausal Stud 1996 Jan-Feb;41(1):56.  The efficacy and tolerability of mifepristone in combination with misoprostol  for termination of early pregnancy (up to 49 days of amenorrhea) are  established. We studied the efficacy and tolerability of this combination  therapy for termination of pregnancy in women up to 63 days of amenorrhea. We  also examined the effect of an additional dose of misoprostol in cases of  nonexpulsion within 3 hours after the first dose. The multicenter trial included  1,108 women, mean age 27.9 +/- 6.2 years. The mean duration of pregnancy was  51.7 +/- 9.2 days. On day 1, the women received an oral dose of mifepristone,  600 mg. On day 3, they received an oral dose of misoprostol, 400 micrograms, and  were monitored for up to 3 hours. If they did not expel the conceptus within 3  hours, an additional dose of 200 micrograms of misoprostol was given and they  were monitored for 2 more hours. From days 10 to 18, the women were followed up  with clinical examination, human chorionic gonadotropin measurement, or  ultrasound examination. Overall, the procedure was successful in 92.9% of women.  Efficacy decreased with the duration of pregnancy, especially after 56 days of  amenorrhea. Up to 42 days of amenorrhea, the success rate was 97.6%; between  days 42 and 49, 94.8%; between days 50 and 56, 93.4%; between days 57 and 63,  86.8%; and after day 63, 83.3%. The most common side effects were moderate  uterine cramps (80.5%) and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (34.9%), especially  vomiting (18.3%) and diarrhea (10.5%). GI symptoms were generally mild. A second  dose of misoprostol was given to 61.6% of the women. In a subgroup analysis, we  assessed the efficacy of 600 mg of mifepristone plus 400 or 600 micrograms of  misoprostol (one or two doses) in women with up to 49 days of amenorrhea and  compared it with the efficacy in women who received mifepristone plus only 400  micrograms (one dose) of misoprostol in a previous study. The overall rate of  success (termination of pregnancy) was 95.5% in the current study compared with  95.4% in the previous study. The additional dose of misoprostol did not  significantly increase the overall rate of success, but did increase the rate of  termination within the monitoring period (69.7% versus 64.9% (and within 72  hours after administration of mifepristone (92.7% versus 90.4%). We have  confirmed that the combination of mifepristone and misoprostol was effective,  safe, and well tolerated for termination of pregnancies at 49 or fewer days of  amenorrhea. The efficacy decreased slightly between 49 and 56 days, and then  decreased significantly between 56 and 63 days. For maximal safety and  tolerability, we recommend this method only for women with 49 or fewer days of  amenorrhea. A second dose of misoprostol did not improve overall efficacy, but  did increase the rate of early termination.  PMID: 8574255 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

[Comparative study of four types of IUDs inserted in women during puerperium for  a period of 28 months in rural areas].  [Article in Chinese]  Li Y.  PIP: This paper is a report of a epidemiological study of the use effectiveness  of four kinds of IUDS: the stainless steel uterine cavity shaped device (UCD),  the stainless steel single ring (SSR), MLCu 250, and the TCu220C in Jiangsu  Province, China. 711 parity one breast-feeding rural women aged 22-32 who were  3-9 months post partum were recruited to participate in the study. They were  randomly assigned for insertion of one of the four kinds of IUDs on the 8th day  after starting the menstrual period. Regular follow-up was conducted after the  IUD insertion. The cumulative discontinuation rate at 28 months was the lowest  for UCD (18.03%). The rate for MLCu 259 was 27.6, for TCu 220c was 28.01%, and  SSR was the highest (50.6%), and by far the worse (p.01). Removal due to  excessive menstrual bleeding or cramping was the highest for TCu 220c (13.83%)  and the lowest for MLCu 250 (2.81%) (p.01). Rural women are usually subjected to  the heavy physical labor of farming, and breast-feeding women generally have  thinner and softer uterine walls. The horizontal arm of TCu 220c may produce  more irritation to the uterine wall than MLCu 250. The conclusion of the study  is that for rural farming women and breast-feeding women, UCD and MLCu would be  better types of IUDs than TCu 220c and SSR.  PMID: 12317374 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

PIP: In order to improve the contraceptive effectiveness of the stainless steel  uterine cavity shaped device (UCD), a copper-plated uterine cavity shaped device  (UCDcu) was developed. A comparative study on these two kinds of IUDs was  conducted between May 1986 and March 1987 involving ten collaborative  institutions. 2009 women aged 20-40 who had regular menstrual cycles without  excessive bleeding and with no history of pelvic infection were recruited for  the study. The UCD cu was inserted in 1004 women, and the UCD was inserted in  1005 women. The insertions were conducted after menstrual periods, after  abortion procedures, during periods when the women were feeding, or after  Cesarean sections. Both groups of women were comparable in their distributions  of age, parity, occupation, and the time period of IUD insertions. They were  examined at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the insertions. The life table method  was used to calculate failure rates, and Chi-square tests were used to examine  the differences in the rates. The 12 months accumulated pregnancy rate was 0.32  in the UCDcu group and 2.99 for the UCD group. The difference was statistically  significant. The differences in expulsion rates and experiences of side effects  were not statistically significant. Excessive menstrual bleeding led to 10  removals in the UCDcu groups and 5 in the UCd group, but there were more  removals due to menstrual cramping in the UCD group than in the UCDcu group  (5:0). The UCDcu is superior to the UCD in pregnancy and expulsion rates is  associated with no significant disadvantages when compared to the UCD. Further  basic and clinical investigations on the UCDcu are warranted.  PMID: 12317372 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

The long-term safety of danazol in women with hereditary angioedema.  Zurlo JJ(1), Frank MM.  Author information: (1)Laboratory of Clinical Investigation, National Institutes of Health,  Bethesda, Maryland 20892.  Although the short-term safety (less than or equal to 6 months) of danazol has  been established in a variety of settings, no information exists as to its  long-term safety. We therefore investigated the long-term safety of danazol by  performing a retrospective chart review of 60 female patients with hereditary  angioedema treated with danazol for a continuous period of 6 months or longer.  The mean age of the patients was 35.2 years and the mean duration of therapy was  59.7 months. Virtually all patients experienced one or more adverse reactions.  Menstrual abnormalities (79%), weight gain (60%), muscle cramps/myalgias (40%),  and transaminase elevations (40%) were the most common adverse reactions. The  drug was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 8 patients. No patient has  died or suffered any apparent long-term sequelae that were directly attributable  to the drug. We conclude that, despite a relatively high incidence of adverse  reactions, danazol has proven to be remarkably safe over the long-term in this  group of patients.

Postconception menses induction using prostaglandin vaginal suppositories.  Foster HW Jr, Smith M, McGruder CE, Richard F, McIntyre J.  Vaginal suppositories containing 15 methyl prostaglandin F2 alpha methyl ester  in a high-melt base were administered to 60 women desiring early pregnancy  interruption who were no more than 56 days' (eight weeks) pregnant as calculated  from the first day of the last regular menstrual period (LMP). The purpose of  this study was to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and patient acceptability of  this mode of noninvasive early abortion. Some factors evaluated during the study  included the time interval from insertion of the suppository to the onset of  cramping and bleeding. Also measured were immediate and delayed blood loss,  nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Of the 60 patients entered into the study, 55  procedures have been judged as successful by the prospective criteria set forth  in the protocol. There were no deaths or serious complications. Four patients  required hospitalization and follow-up dilatation and curettage (D&C). One  patient withdrew from the study after receiving a suppository and subsequently  delivered a preterm infant.

Pendergrass PB, Scott JN, Ream LJ, Agna MA.  90 women participated in a 4-month study. During the first 2 periods, they took  no pain relievers whatsoever; during their last 2 periods they took 2 X 325 mg  aspirin, acetaminophen or an identically packaged placebo every 4 h to total 8  tablets during the first 24 h of their periods beginning with spotting. For  statistical analysis, periods 1 and 2 were combined and averaged, then compared  with periods 3 and 4 combined and averaged. Total menstrual loss in grams,  number of days of flow, and pain of cramps and headaches were analyzed by MANOVA  for each of the three treatment groups. An ANOVA for each of these variables as  well as for daily menstrual loss for the first 3 menstrual days was also  performed. The MANOVA for all variables by the three treatment groups failed to  show any significant differences. Similarly, ANOVAs for the individual variables  failed to indicate significant differences except for the variable pain of  cramps (p = 0.0072). The Duncan's Multiple Range Test for pain of cramps showed  that the average pain for the placebo group was higher than for either the  aspirin or the acetaminophen group, although the means for these two groups were  not significantly different. These results indicate that neither aspirin nor  acetaminophen in the doses given alter either total menstrual loss or the  pattern of loss during the first 3 menstrual days. However, both preparations  were found to be more effective than placebo in reducing pain of cramps.  DOI: 10.1159/000299005 PMID: 3886498 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

This study was conducted to evaluate the safety, efficacy and acceptability of  PGE1 vaginal suppositories (Pg ONO 802) in menstrual regulation. Each vaginal  suppository contains 1 mg of 16,16 dimethyl-trans-delta 2 PGE1 methyl ester.  Five suppositories were inserted as high as possible into the fornix posterior  of the vagina at intervals of 3 h. Five hundred thirty four subjects with delay  of menses mostly of up to 14 days were included in the study. Blood chemistry  was evaluated and urine analysis performed in all subjects. Success of treatment  was assessed on two alternative groups of criteria: (A) induction of bleeding by  Pg ONO 802; (B) induction of bleeding achieved by Pg ONO 802 and not followed by  surgical intervention. The success rate based on criteria A was 98.9%, and on  criteria B 86%. If heavy bleeding occurred and signs of pregnancy were found  during the trial period, intervention was made by vacuum aspiration or curettage  when necessary. If bleeding did not occur and/or pregnancy continued, treatment  was declared a failure and pregnancy was terminated by vacuum extraction or  curettage. For non-pregnant subjects no intervention was made but careful  re-evaluation was carried out. Mean duration of bleeding after Pg ONO 802  treatment was 6.7 days. Side-effects were generally mild. The incidence of  diarrhea was 8.8%, nausea 7.8%, headache 5.8%, vomiting 2.8%; abdominal cramp  occurred in as many as 66% of subjects. No treatment was given for these  side-effects as they were within acceptable limits.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250  WORDS)  PIP: The safety, efficacy, and acceptability of menstrual regulation with  prostaglandin (PG) El vaginal suppositories was investagated in 534 women whose  menses was delayed up to 8 weeks from the last menstrual period. 5  suppositories, each containing 1 mg of 16,16 dimethyl-trans-delta 2 PG El methyl  ester, were inserted high in the vagina at 3 hour intervals. The success of  treatment was assessed by 2 alternate criteria: 1) induction of bleeding, or 2)  induction of bleeding and no surgical intervention. The success rate was 98.9%  according to the 1st criterion and 86% according to the 2nd criterion. The mean  duration of bleeding after treatment was 6.7 days. 47.9% of women experienced  moderate bleeding and 43.8% reported heavy bleeding following treatment.  Surgical intervention (curettage or vacuum aspiration) was required in 74 of the  528 bleeding cases and in 1 of the 6 nonbleeding cases with positive signs of  pregnancy. The surgical intervention was performed because bleeding was  considered to be either excessive or prolonged. Side effects tended to manifest  themselves between the 1st and 2nd administration of suppositories. Abdominal  cramps occurred in 66% of subjects; other side effects were minimal, including  vomiting (2.8%), headache (5.8%), nausea (7.8%), and diarrhea (8.8%). These  findings suggest that menstrual regulation with PGE1 suppositories is a safe  method with the advantages of ease of administration, reversibility, a high  success rate, acceptable bleeding duration, only mild side effects, and  induction of menses without the need for surgical intervention. The simplicity  of vaginal administration offers potential for self-treatment. Use of this  method of menstrual regulation could be especially advantageious in countries  with restrictive abortion laws. Single administration of a suppository, or  parenteral administration, could improve the acceptability of this method.  DOI: 10.1016/0020-7292(84)90075-4 PMID: 6151928 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"
6481117,Abdominal manifestations of actinomycosis in IUD users.,"Asuncion CM, Cinti DC, Hawkins HB","1. J Clin Gastroenterol. 1984 Aug;6(4):343-8.  Abdominal manifestations of actinomycosis in IUD users.  Asuncion CM, Cinti DC, Hawkins HB.  The use of an intrauterine device (IUD) is associated with the presence of  actinomyces in the female genital tract. Since IUD use is currently so  prevalent, IUD-related pelvic inflammatory disease occasionally spreads to the  rest of the abdomen. Two patients with abdominal actinomycosis in association  with an IUD illustrate the problem; we review the general problem.  PIP: 2 case reports are presented of IUN wearers with advanced actinomycotic  disease. In both women there was extensive involvement of the bowel and in 1  woman deposits in the liver. The discussion covers the objectives of making a  preoperative diagonsis, initiating antibiotic therapy, and potentially obviating  or limiting surgical intervention. A 44-year old black woman complained of  gradually increasing abdominal girth, weight loss, weakness, and pedal edema.  Her last menstrual period had been 5 months prior to admission. She had an IUD  in place for 11 years and was sexually inactive. She was a cachectic woman with  a temperature of 100 degrees Farenheit, bilateral inguinal adenopathy, and 1+  pedal edema. Barium studies revealed an IUD in the right side of the pelvis and  a large soft tissue mass pressing upon and intimately adherent to the sigmoid  colon. At laparotomy, mumerous adhesions were encountered and a large cavitated  mass was found to occupy the entire left side of the pelvis. Fistulas extended  from it to both the sigmoid colon and the small bowel. Frozen sections revealed  fibrosis and inflammaion with confluent granulomas. Gram stains of the exudate  showed sulfur granules suggesting atinomycotic infection. A total hysterectomy  and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy were performed and the intestinal fistuals  were repaired. Examination of the resected specimens showed a Majzlin Spring IUD  imbeded in the endometrium and myometrium. In the immediate postoperative  period, the patient was treated with high dose intravenous antibiotic therapy  and on discharge she was continued on oral penicillin. The 2nd case, a  previously healthy 53 year old white woman gave a 2 month history of  intermittent lower adbominal pain, cramping and alternating diarrhea and  constipation. Her last menstrual period had been 6 months earlier and she  claimed to have forgotten about a Dalkon Shield IUD which had been in place for  20 years. AT laparotomy, a firm infiltrating mass was found to involve the  uterus, left fallopian tube, sigmoid colon, and pelvic side walls. Gross  pathologic examination demonstrated extensive acute and chronic inflammation and  granulation of the left fallopian tube, uterus, and sigmoid colon. The sigmoid  showed thickening of musculas layers, reactive fibrosis in the submucosa,  subserosa, and mesentery, and areas of formation of small sinus tracts and/or  abscesses. A single sulfur granule was found within the lumen of the left  fallopian tube. Gram stain of this demonstrated the characteristic filamentous  nature of actinomyces. After surgery, Cefoxitan was continued and intravenous  penicillin was added. Both patients were postmenopausal and had forgotten about  their IUDs. Millions of women with IUDs are know to be asymptomatic carriers of  actinomycosis by virtue of the appearance of the bacillus on routine Pap smears.  Most of these women are still menstruating. Possibly cyclical menstrual flow is  something of a cleansing mechanism protecting these women from actinomycotic  infection.  PMID: 6481117 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

PIP: To correlate the position and orientation of different models of MLCu IUDs  in utero with incidence of side effects, 35 married, nonlactating, and sexually  active women, 18-24 years of age and with regular menstrual periods were  studied. All had been pregnant at least once and had had at least 3 menstrual  periods after the last delivery or 2 periods after the last abortion. A physical  and gynecological examination was performed. The women were divided into 4  groups: 30 women (3 groups of 10 patients) were fitted with standard MLCu 250,  short MLCu 250, and MLCu 375 IUDs. The 4th group consisted of 5 women in whom  MLCu 250 mini was inserted. Menstrual blood loss collected in cotton pads of  constant weight provided by the investigator. The women were carefully  instructed on how to collect their menstrual blood, and polyethylene bags were  supplied to them. Menstrual blood loss was calculated. Follow-up visits were  planned at monthly intervals, and questions about side effects were asked. In 30  women hysterography was done twice. Initially, it was performed following the  1st postinsertion menstruation. A 2nd hysterogram was performed following the  3rd postinsertion menstruation. The IUD was properly oriented in utero in 20  cases (67%). These were fitted with short MLCu 250 (8 cases), MLCu 375 (6  cases), Standard MLCu 250 (4 cases), and mini MLCu 250 (2 cases). The other 2  patients had small uterine cavities fitted with mini devices. Device  displacement was noted in 10 cases among those fitted with MLCu 250, Standard (2  cases), MLCu 250 mini (3 cases), MLCu 375 (2 cases). Subjective increased  menstrual blood loss was reported in 11 cases. There was no significant  difference between pre- and postinsertion menstrual blood loss. Intermenstrual  bleeding was reported in 3 cases, 1 fitted with a short MLCu 250 and 2 cases  fitted with MLCu 375. Hysterographically the device was properly oriented in 2  cases with a large uterus. 5 cases had a moderate degree of dysmenorrhea, 1 case  fitted with short MLCu 250, 3 cases with standard MLCu 250, and 1 case with MLCu  375. Hysterographically the device was displaced in utero in 2 cases, and most  of the cases had a large size uterus. All these patients experienced no  dysmenorrhea prior to IUD insertion. Moderate deep seated pelvic pain and low  abdominal cramps were experienced in 3 cases, a case in each group of those  fitted with different models of MLCu 250. Pain was not reported in patients  fitted with MLCu 375.  PMID: 12265365 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Woods NF, Most A, Dery GK.  The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of perimenstrual  symptoms (PMS) in a free-living population of US women and to determine if  prevalence estimates varied with parity, contraceptive status, characteristics  of the menstrual cycle, and selected demographic variables. We identified all  households from a census listing for five southeastern city neighborhoods that  offered variation in racial composition and socioeconomic status. We ascertained  all households in which there was one nonpregnant woman between the ages of 18  and 35 years per household. Of the 241 eligible women, 179 (74 per cent)  participated in the study. Trained interviewers administered the Moos Menstrual  Distress Questionnaire (MDQ) and other demographic measures to women between  March and July 1979. Symptoms with a prevalence greater than 30 per cent  included weight gain, headache, skin disorders, cramps, anxiety, backache,  fatigue, painful breasts, irritability, mood swings, depression, or tension.  Only 2 to 8 per cent of women found most of these severe or disabling. The  exceptions were severe cramps reported by 17 per cent of women and severe  premenstrual and menstrual irritability by 12 per cent. Cramps, backaches,  fatigue, and tension were most prevalent during the menstruum; weight gain, skin  disorders, painful breasts, swelling, irritability, mood swings, and depression  were more prevalent in the premenstruum. Parity, oral contraceptive use, age,  employment, education, and income were negatively associated with selected PMS.  Use of an IUD, having long menstrual cycles, long menstrual flow, or heavy  menstrual flow, and being able to predict the next period were positively  associated with selected PMS. Race had both positive and negative effects on  PMS.  DOI: 10.2105/ajph.72.11.1257 PMCID: PMC1650411 PMID: 6889817 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

PIP: 39 women using the Lippes loop C, and complaining of chronic pelvic pain  dating from after insertion of the IUD, were investigated by laparoscopy and  transuterine pelvic venography in the premenstrual period of the cycle. Patients  complaining only of cramp-like pain similar to spasmodic dysmenorrhea were not  included. Other types of pain noticed were dull aching low abdomen, deep seated  pelvic pain with associated dyspareunia, and low backache mainly on the sacrum.  Pain was attributed to the presence of pelvic variocele diagnosed by laparoscopy  (52%), and venography (95%), chronic pelvic inflammatory disease (28%), and  pelvic adhesions (8%). The sites of maximum pain correlated well with the sites  of maximum varicosities and/or venous stasis. Menorrhagia was associated with  pain in one-third of the cases and was explained on the basis of increased  pelvic vascularity, chronic pelvic inflammatory disease, and cystic changes in  the ovaries. The possible factors predisposing to uterine perforation during  venography in 3 cases are discussed.  PMID: 12278588 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

PIP: The mechanism of effectiveness of the Progestasert progesterone-releasing  iud has not been definitively established. Only slight changes have been  observed in the hormone profiles of women using the Progestasert system, e.g. a  postponement of the LH peak, increase in the length of the corpus luteum phase,  and increased progesterone secretion. Hypomennorrhea and silent menstruation are  reported among women who use the Progestasert system for longer periods of time.  Of 103 patients who used the Progestasert, a continuation rate of 81.8% was  reported after 12 months. 1 pregnancy and 1 ectopic pregnancy occurred in 887  cycles. There were 2 expulsions; 15 IUDs were removed, mostly due to bleeding  irregularities. Genital infections and cramp-like pains are less frequent than  among copper-IUD users. Breakthrough bleeding and spotting were more frequent  than among copper-IUD users. In a group of 150 women who had the IUD removed  because of a wish to become pregnant, a conception rate of 49 after 3 months and  76 after 12 months was recorded. These data are similar to those from users of  other IUDs. The length of time that the Progestasert was used had no effect on  the conception rate. The Progestasert is preferred for women suffering from  dysmenorrhea or hyperamenorrhea.  PMID: 569628 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Section 2 entitled ""facts that may be helpful in  prescribing or changing the prescription of oral contraceptives"" includes  potency of progestins and estrogens and symptoms indicating excessive or  deficient progestin and estrogen activity. Contraindications such as migraine  headaches, epilepsy, hepatic disease, renal disease and hypertension are among  the reasons for obtaining a complete family history prior to prescription of  oral contraceptives. This information provides the basis for choice of  contraception tailored to the individual. A 100 pound 17 year old with a normal  menstrual history and with adequate estrogen production would be safest with a  medication low in estrogen and progestin. An older heavier woman with prolonged  menstruation and cramps would require a pill which is potent in progestins since  these are excellent for causing endometrium regression and vascular reduction.  Length of time on oral c ontraceptives depends upon the patient's general  health. If responding well to contraceptives the patient should continue to use  them because 1) the body is programmed for lengthy periods of ovulation  suppression; 2) the patient becomes accustomed to infertility and 3) too many  unplanned pregnancies occur during rest intervals. Complaints of nausea,  migraine headaches, change in libido, chloasma or thrombophlebitis determine the  termination of the drug.  PMID: 1127361 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"
4208342,A double-blind comparison of two oral contraceptives containing 50 mu g. and 30 mu g. ethinyl estradiol.,"Dionne P, Vickerson F","1. Curr Ther Res Clin Exp. 1974 Apr;16(4):281-8.  A double-blind comparison of two oral contraceptives containing 50 mu g. and 30  mu g. ethinyl estradiol.  Dionne P, Vickerson F.  PIP: 150 women participated in a double-blind clinical trial comparing 2 dosages  of an oral contraceptive agent: 250 mcg d-norgestrel + 50 mcg ethinyl estradiol  and 150 mcg d-norgestrel + 30 mcg ethinyl estradiol. The 150/30 combination  resulted in shorter cycles, longer menses (p.001), shorter latent period  (p.001), and a higher instance of breakthrough bleeding and spotting (p.05 and  p.001). The 250/50 dose caused a significantly higher incidence of breast  discomfort (p.001), leg cramps (.02), and nausea (.001). More 250/50 dose women  dropped out for more than 1 reason than in the lower dose group.  PMID: 4208342 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 1973 Apr;36(4):784-7. doi: 10.1210/jcem-36-4-784.  Prostaglandin E2 and the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle: effects on blood  progesterone, estradiol, cortisol, and growth hormone levels.  Henzl MR, Ortega E, Cortés-Gallegos V, Tomlinson RV, Segre EJ.  PIP: An intravenous infusion of (PGE2) prostaglandin E was given for 8 hours on  2-3 consecutive days to 7 normally cycling women during various periods of the  luteal phase, and to 1 woman whose luteal phase was prolonged by hCG  administration. 3 women were infused with saline solution only. During PGE2  infusion, 2 hourly blood samples showed some variations in progesterone and  estradiol levels regardless of the period of the luteal phase; no clear-cut  depression was noted. These changes were similar to the spontaneous variations  seen in controls. PGE2 did not induce intermenstrual bleeding or premature  menstruation, although uterine contractility was markedly increased. In 1  subject, PGE2 was given during the early postovulatory period without  interfering with implantation and subsequent normal pregnancy. An increase of  cortisol and GH blood levels was also observed during PGE2 infusion. We conclude  that PGE in the dosage used is not luteolytic in humans.

12331821,Experience with ethynodiol diacetate and mestranol as an oral contraceptive.,"Gidwani GP, Purandare BN","1. J Obstet Gynaecol India. 1968 Apr;18(2):287-93.  Experience with ethynodiol diacetate and mestranol as an oral contraceptive.  Gidwani GP, Purandare BN.  PIP: A study was made in Bombay, India of oral contraception using 2  combinations of ethynodiol diacetate and mestranol in 521 women over a period of  3 years with a total of 5196 menstrual cycles. The women were divided into 2  groups: 1 using 1 mg of ethynodiol diacetate plus .1 mg of mestranol and the  other using .5 mg of ethynodiol diacetate and .1 mg of mestranol. 70% of the  women studied were aged 21-30 years. Women over 35 and those with more than 3  children were urged to undergo operative procedures. Most had used no  contraceptive method previously, 56.6% desired planned families, and 43.4%  wanted no more children. There was a monthly interview when a new supply of  tablets was distributed. No pregnancies followed in either group when tablets  were taken regularly, but 2 did occur otherwise. Side effects were most severe  during the first cycle. 55 women (10.5%) discontinued medication at the end of 3  years because of side effects. 267 discontinued the program because pills were  not available near their homes. Of these, 71 became pregnant over the 3-year  period, only 10 of whom desired pregnancy. None showed evidence of  thromboembolic phenomena. Liver function tests showed no change. The cycle  length of most women taking the preparations became more regular at 27-28 days.  There was little difference in side effects of the 2 preparations.  PMID: 12331821 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"
